The [NGINX-based Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) has additional configuration options and features that can be customized. The functionality is split into two categories:

- [Per-Service options](#yaml) in each Ingress' YAML definition either directly or via [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) ([Complete list of supported Annotations](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/)).
- [Global options](#configmap) that influence all Ingresses of a cluster via a ConfigMap ([Complete list of ConfigMap options](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/)).

**Note**: Giant Swarm clusters do not come with an ingress controller pre-installed. See our [guide on how to install an ingress from the Giant Swarm Catalog]({{< relref "/getting-started/ingress-controller" >}}).

## Per-Service options {#yaml}

### Aggregating Ingresses

You can aggregate several Ingress rules into a single Ingress definition like following:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE_1.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_1_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_1_PORT
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE_2.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_2_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_2_PORT
```

__Note:__ If you are using TLS you also need each of the hosts in the `tls` section (see below) of the yaml.

### Path Based Fanout

You can route an Ingress to different Services based on the path:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE_1.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_1_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_1_PORT
      - path: /bar
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_2_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_2_PORT
```

__Note:__ Your applications need to be capable of running on a non-root path either by default or by setting the base path in their configuration.

### TLS

If your cluster has TLS enabled, you can terminate TLS either in your application itself by enabling SSL passthrough or let the Ingress Controller terminate for you.

#### SSL passthrough

__Warning:__ This feature was disabled by default in Nginx ingress controller managed by Giant Swarm. Reason is a potential [crash](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2354) of internal TCP proxier. We recommend to [terminate TLS in ingress controller](#terminating-tls-in-ingress-controller) instead.

For SSL passthrough you need to set an annotation and enable TLS for the host:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
   tls:
   - hosts:
     - YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_PORT
```

__Note:__ SSL passthrough cannot work with path based routing based on the nature of SSL.

#### Terminating TLS in Ingress Controller

For terminating TLS in the Ingress Controller you need to first create a TLS secret containing your certificate and private key in the same namespace as the Ingress object:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/tls
metadata:
  name: TLS_SECRET
data:
  tls.crt: BASE64_ENCODED_CERT
  tls.key: BASE64_ENCODED_KEY
```

__Note:__ the data keys must be named `tls.crt` and `tls.key`!

Referencing this secret in an Ingress will tell the Ingress Controller to secure the channel from the client to the loadbalancer using TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
   tls:
   - hosts:
     - YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
     secretName: TLS_SECRET
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_PORT
```

__Tip:__ If you want to use [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates with your domains you can automate their creation and renewal with the help of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). After configuring cert-manager there is only an annotation with your Ingresses needed and your web page will be secured by a valid `TLS` certificate. You can learn more about this behavior [here]({{< relref "/advanced/tls-certificates" >}}).

### Authentication

The Ingress Controller includes support for adding authentication to an Ingress rule. You have the choice between [basic or digest http authentication types](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617).

First, you need to create a file called `auth` containing your usernames and passwords (one per line). You can do this either by using the [`htpasswd`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) command line tool (like in the following example) or an online htpasswd generator.

```nohighlight
$ htpasswd -c auth foo1
New password: PASSWORD
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user foo1
```

You can add users to the same file with:

```nohighlight
$ htpasswd auth foo2
New password: PASSWORD
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user foo2
```

Next, we create a secret containing our `auth` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: AUTH_SECRET
data:
  auth: BASE64_ENCODED_AUTH
```

Last, we create the Ingress with the according annotations:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
  annotations:
    # type of authentication [basic|digest]
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
    # name of the secret that contains the user/password definitions
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: AUTH_SECRET
    # message to display with an appropiate context why the authentication is required
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: "Authentication Required - foo"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_PORT
```

### External Authentication

To use an existing service that provides authentication the Ingress rule can be annotated with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url` to indicate the URL where the HTTP request should be sent. Additionally it is possible to set `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-method` to specify the HTTP method to use (GET or POST).

This functionality is based on the [auth_request](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) module, which expects a `2xx` response code from the external service if the access is allowed and `401` or `403` if denied.

### CORS

To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in an Ingress rule add the annotation `ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"`.

### Rewrite

In some scenarios the exposed URL in the backend service differs from the specified path in the Ingress rule. Without a rewrite any request will return 404. To circumvent this you can set the annotation `ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.

This can for example be used together with path based routing, when the application expects to be on `/`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: YOUR_CHOICE.CLUSTER_ID.k8s.gigantic.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: SERVICE_NAME
            port:
              number: SERVICE_PORT
```

If the application contains relative links it is possible to add an additional annotation `ingress.kubernetes.io/add-base-url` that will prepend a [`base` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) in the header of the returned HTML from the backend.

### Rate limiting

The annotations `ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections` and `ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps` define a limit on the connections that can be opened by a single client IP address. This can be used to mitigate [DDoS Attacks](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-ddos-attacks-with-nginx-and-nginx-plus).

`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections`: number of concurrent connections allowed from a single IP address.

`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps`: number of connections that may be accepted from a given IP each second.

If you specify both annotations in a single Ingress rule, `limit-rps` takes precedence.

### Secure backends

By default NGINX uses `http` to reach the services. Adding the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"` in the Ingress rule changes the protocol to `https`.

### Server-side HTTPS enforcement through redirect

By default the controller redirects (301) to `HTTPS` if TLS is enabled for that Ingress. If you want to disable that behaviour, you can use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"` annotation.

### Whitelist source range

You can specify the allowed client IP source ranges through the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range` annotation. The value is a comma separated list of [CIDRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing), e.g. `10.0.0.0/24,172.10.0.1`.

__Note:__ Adding an annotation to an Ingress rule overrides any global restrictions set in the NGINX Ingress Controller.

### Custom max body size

A 413 error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. This size can be configured by the parameter [`client_max_body_size`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size) and is set to `1m` (1 Megabyte) by default.

To configure this setting globally for all Ingress rules, the `proxy-body-size` value may be set in the [NGINX ConfigMap](#configmap).

To use custom values in a specific Ingress add following annotation:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m
```

### Session Affinity

The annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` enables and sets the affinity type in all upstreams of an Ingress. This way, a request will always be directed to the same upstream server.

#### Cookie affinity

If you use the `cookie` type you can also specify the name of the cookie that will be used to route the requests with the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name`. The default is to create a cookie named `route`.

The annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash` defines which algorithm will be used to hash the used upstream. Default value is `md5` and possible values are `md5`, `sha1` and `index`.

The `index` option is not hashed, an in-memory index is used instead, it's quicker and the overhead is shorter. Warning: The matching against the upstream servers list is inconsistent. So, at reload, if upstreams servers have changed, index values are not guaranted to correspond to the same server as before! Use with caution and only if you need to!

This feature is implemented by the third party module [nginx-sticky-module-ng](https://bitbucket.org/nginx-goodies/nginx-sticky-module-ng). The workflow used to define which upstream server will be used is explained in the [module documentation (PDF)](https://bitbucket.org/nginx-goodies/nginx-sticky-module-ng/raw/08a395c66e425540982c00482f55034e1fee67b6/docs/sticky.pdf).

### Configuration snippets

The NGINX Ingress Controller creates an NGINX configuration file. You can directly pass chunks of configuration, so-called _configuration snippets_, into any ingress manifest. These snippets will be added to the NGINX configuration.

The _configuration snippets_ through Ingress annotations is disabled by default. To enable parsing of _configuration snippets_, you'll need to set `controller.allowSnippetAnnotations: true` in the [App configuration]({{< relref "/developer-platform/app-platform/app-configuration/index.md" >}}).

Warning: We recommend enabling this option only if you TRUST users with permission to create Ingress objects, as this may allow a user to add restricted configurations to the final nginx.conf file.

Here is an example adding an `Expires` header to every response:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: INGRESS_NAME
  namespace: NAMESPACE
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
   expires 24h;
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: host.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: http-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
```

Make sure to use the exact annotation scheme `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` in the `metadata` section of the manifest.

In case you want to set up a general http snippet you can define it at [NGINX ConfigMap](#configmap) level.

## Global (per cluster) options {#configmap}

Your Giant Swarm installation comes with a default configuration for the Ingress Controller.

You can override these defaults by setting your per cluster configuration in the form of a ConfigMap named `nginx-ingress-controller-user-values` in the management cluster.

The page [App configuration reference]({{< relref "/developer-platform/app-platform/app-configuration/index.md" >}}) contains more information how to set user defined configuration for the nginx-ingress-controller-app.

### Where is the user values ConfigMap

Given the cluster you are trying to configure has id: `123ab`

You will find the `nginx-ingress-controller-user-values` ConfigMap on the management cluster in the `123ab` namespace:

```nohighlight
$ kubectl -n 123ab get cm nginx-ingress-controller-user-values
NAME                                   DATA      AGE
nginx-ingress-controller-user-values   0         11m
```

__Warning:__

Please do not edit any of the other NGINX ingress related ConfigMaps.

Only the user ConfigMap is safe to edit.

---

### How to set configuration options using the user values ConfigMap

You are able to set any value from the [upstream documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/) by including them in the user values ConfigMap under the `data.values` field like so:

```yaml
# On the management cluster

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller-app-user-values
  namespace: NAMESPACE
data:
  values: |
    configmap:
      log-format-upstream: "MY EDITED LOG FORMAT - $status $body_bytes_sent $http_referer"
```

However keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility.

If the ConfigMap does not exist, create it. In this case you'll need to reference it in the App CR of the ingress controller.

```yaml
# Add missing keys to the spec field of the App CR

spec:
  userConfig:
    configMap:
      name: nginx-ingress-controller-app-user-values
      namespace: NAMESPACE
```

Any defaults that we override are visible in the following `values.yaml` file, under the `configmap` key. [Check this values.yaml file in v2.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/v2.2.0/helm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/values.yaml) as an example.

Do not copy all the defaults if you do not need to change them, that way we can adjust them in case they need to change.

Do make sure you look at the right tag of that repository, when reading this file check that the tag
corresponds to the version of the nginx-ingress-controller-app running on your cluster.

---
### Enable Proxy Protocol

__Warning:__

We also allow setting `use-proxy-protocol: "true"/"false"`. This setting always applies globally for the `nginx-ingress-controller`. All applications providing services behind ingresses need to understand this protocol or they will fail. Furthermore, the load balancer in front of the ingress controller also needs to be set up correctly.

#### CAPA

The use of the proxy protocol requires to configure the `LoadBalancer` associated with the `Service` in front of Nginx IC with the right annotation. It's possible to do this by setting the `controller.service.annotations` value in the user values ConfigMap.

Here is an example adding the annotations `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol` to the public and the internal services:
```yaml
# On the management cluster

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller-app-user-values
  namespace: NAMESPACE
data:
  values: |
    configmap:
      use-proxy-protocol: "true"
    controller:
      internal:
        service:
          annotations:
            service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
      service:
        annotations:
          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
```

#### AWS

The proxy protocol is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting the `use-proxy-protocol` to `false`.

For example:
```yaml
# On the management cluster

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller-app-user-values
  namespace: NAMESPACE
data:
  values: |
    configmap:
      use-proxy-protocol: "false"
```

---

### Default certificate

When you want to have the default server on the nginx controller support TLS you need to provide a certificate. This is configured using the flag `--default-ssl-certificate`. Now you can provide this value in the user values ConfigMap to force the component to be restarted with the provided certificate. The value of the property should be the namespace and secret name which holds the certificate content.

```yaml
data:
  values: |
    controller:
       defaultSSLCertificate: "custom.prefix.io"
```

### Custom annotation prefix

By default we use the standard annotation prefix `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` in the ingress controller. In case the customer needs to have a specific one this can be done via the user values ConfigMap. This is recommended when there is more than one ingress controller. So in the ingress resource the prefix can be used to distinguish between controllers.

```yaml
data:
  values: |
    controller:
      annotationsPrefix: "custom.prefix.io"
```
