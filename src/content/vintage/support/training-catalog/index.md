In Giant Swarm we perceive the Cloud Native Landscape as a journey and it takes time and effort to get across it successfully. Based on the lessons learnt through these years helping our customers, we have built a set of trainings that develop several areas of the journey that guide the teams to understand the principles and the tools. The trainings are why-focused rather than how-focused, meaning that we aim to explain the reasons behind the tools and practices, rather than just how to use them.
