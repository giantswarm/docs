title: Workload cluster release v18.4.1 for AWS
---

This release contains small improvements. It disables ETCD compaction request from apiserver which is included in etcd by default and upgrades `observability-bundle`.

***Important for IRSA***
When upgrading to AWS Release `v18.4.1` you can additionally set a annotation on AWSCluster CR `alpha.aws.giantswarm.io/enable-cloudfront-alias: ""` to enable the usage of the Cloudfront alternate domain name before v19 where it will be a default. This is useful if you want to take immeditate actions replacing `Kiam`.

***IAM Permissions Requirements***
The minimal requirement for the IAM permissions is [Version 3.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#320---2023-04-27) of [giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/) repository.
