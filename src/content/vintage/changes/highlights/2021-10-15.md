## General

As part of our continuous effort to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where appropriate, we phase out the term "key pair" and will instead use "client certificate" in the future. Expect this to land in the web UI and documentation soon. Commands in `gsctl` will not be affected by the change however.

## User interfaces

We have added changes to `kubectl gs`:

- The `template cluster` and `template nodepool` commands for release `v20.0.0` now use Management API for defaulting, making it the same across providers including Cluster API (for AWS, AWS using EKS, and for Azure).
