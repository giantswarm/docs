## Managed apps

[Cert Manager v2.7.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/cert-manager-app/v2.7.0/) upgrades to upstream v1.3.1, which fixes an issue preventing app upgrades.

[Kong v2.0.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/kong-app/v2.0.0/) upgrades to upstream stable v2.0.0. Make sure to review the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/CHANGELOG.md#200) and the [upgrade documentation](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/blob/master/helm/kong-app/UPGRADE.md), as support for Helm 2 as well as other 1.x features are dropped. Customers running 1.2.0 have no disruptions.

## User interfaces

[kubectl gs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/kubectl-gs/), our plug-in for the Giant Swarm Management API, is now available as binary for the ARM achitecture (e. g. Apple M1), both for Linux and macOS.

## Documentation

We now provide a curated list of [cost optimization](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/cost-optimization/) tools for Kubernetes.
