## Apps

Released `flux-app` version `v0.20.2` that contains Flux upgraded to `v.37.0` (was `v0.36.0`) as part of [v0.20.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v0.20.0). The major highlights of Flux `v0.37.0` are:

- The interpretation of the `gitImplementation` field of `GitRepository` by *source-controller* and *image-automation-controller* has been deprecated, and will effectively always use `go-git` (+ see next item on how to disable forcing this behavior).
- ImageUpdateAutomation objects with a `.spec.PushBranch` specified will have the push branch refreshed automatically via force push.
    - In `flux-app` version [v0.20.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v0.20.2) we added a new Helm value: `imageAutomationController.featureGatesToDisable` - with restricted values of `GitForcePushBranch` and `ForceGoGitImplementation` - that can be used to disable this force push behavior by adding `GitForcePushBranch` to the list. By default no feature gates are disabled
- `ImagePolicy` CRD dropped version `v1alpha1`
- `ImageRepository` CRD dropped version `v1alpha1`
- `ImageUpdateAutomation` CRD dropped version `v1alpha1`

Additionally `flux-app` contains the following updates as well:

- Added capability to attach custom annotations and labels to `kustomize-contoller` pod via setting the `kustomizeController.podTemplate.annotations` and `kustomizeController.podTemplate.labels` fields
- Added capability to attach custom annotations to the `kustomize-controller` service account via `kustomizeServiceAccount.annotations` field
- Increased memory limits for CRD install job as it was observed to frequently get OOM killed

## User interfaces

In [kubectl-gs v2.29.3](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/kubectl-gs/kubectl-gs/v2.29.3/) we fixed logging in to clusters running on custom domains.
