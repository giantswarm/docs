## User interfaces

Through a mistake, `kubectl gs` v1.28.0 hasn't been published via the Krew index. We fixed this in the meantime and you can use `kubectl krew upgrade gs` to get the latest version again.

Also we provide an experimental build of `kubectl gs` for Windows. You can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/pull/352#issuecomment-843279890) for download. If you try it, we'd be very happy to hear your feedback!

## Documentation

These weekly announcements now also appear in the Changes and Releases section, as their own category named [Highlights](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/highlights/).
