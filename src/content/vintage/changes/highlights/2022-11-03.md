## Management API

As a cluster admin, you now have the ability to view logs from all pods on the management clusters, enabling an additional degree of self-service towards debugging deployments that may be failing for reasons which are not clear from the resource status field. These logs can be accessed via the `kubectl logs` command.

## Apps

- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) [v0.17.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v0.17.0) updates Flux toolkit to [v0.36.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.36.0), which includes a fix that reduces kustomize-controller's memory usage by 90%. It contains no breaking changes.
- [k8s-dns-node-cache-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/k8s-dns-node-cache-app)[v1.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/k8s-dns-node-cache-app/releases/tag/v1.0.0) is promoted to the Giant Swarm catalog together with the latest updates of app components.
