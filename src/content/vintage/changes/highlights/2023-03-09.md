## Apps

- [nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app) [v2.26.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v2.26.0) We are in the process in aligning our nginx-ingress-controller-app in the direction of upstream nginx-ingress controller. In this first step we implemented 16 new service properties. Please be aware of `controller.service.clusterIP` as the cluster IP of existing services can not be changed. The app deployment might fail when defining this for already installed app instances. Also please be aware of `controller.service.healthCheckNodePort` as the health check node port of existing services can not be changed. The app deployment might fail when defining this for already installed app instances. All other implemented service properties are mentioned [here](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v2.26.0). Additionally to the new implementations 11 service properties got changed and all values got aligned to upstream NGINX, please also view the changes [here](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v2.26.0). To complete the first step of our alignment we also removed `controller.service.internal.labels` in favor of `controller.service.labels`, `controller.service.internal.type` in favor of `controller.service.type`, `controller.service.internal.ports.http`in favor of `controller.service.ports.http` and `controller.service.internal.ports.https` in favor `controller.service.ports.https`. These changes come straight from nginx-ingress-controller upstream and can also be viewed [here](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v2.26.0).
