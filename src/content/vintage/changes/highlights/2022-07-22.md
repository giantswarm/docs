## General

- We split Flux related alerts to `Giant Swarm` and `Customer` alerts based on which Flux reconciles the resources. `Giant Swarm` alerts remain in `alert` mode for `Team Honey Badger` while `Customer` alerts were moved to `notify` mode. Eventually `Customer` notifications will be routed to customers via chosen Flux native channels.

## Apps

- `app-operator` version `v6.2.0` now supports a list of extra configuration layers than can be applied to the 3 core - catalog, cluster, user - configuration levels. You can read more about it at: https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/app-configuration/#extra-configs
