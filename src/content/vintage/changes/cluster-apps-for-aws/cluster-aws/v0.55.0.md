### Fixed
- Change `KubeadmConfig` bootstrap config reference to ensure nodes get rolled when making changes to node specification (requires newer versions of CAPI/CAPA as shown in the original [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/8858)). Add machine pool instance warmup setting (5 minutes) to ensure nodes do not get replaced too quickly.
- Run kubeadm after containerd to avoid node startup problems
