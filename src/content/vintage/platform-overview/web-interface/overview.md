If we did our job well then our web interface is so intuitive and
easy to use that this reference isn't necessary.

However, for those of you interested in having an overview of what is possible
with our web interface, and how to access it, read on!

## Where can I find the web interface {#where-to-find}

The URL to your installation's web interface is handed to you once Giant Swarm
staff finishes the initial setup.

The hostname in the URL usually starts with `happa`, which is our nickname for
the application.

## What can I do with the web interface

Our web interface lets you do the following things. Some topics link to more
detailed information:

- [View and manage organizations]({{< relref "/vintage/platform-overview/web-interface/organizations" >}})
- View and manage clusters
- Learn how to get started with your workload clusters by following a guide
- [Add, remove and configure Apps on your clusters]({{< relref "/vintage/platform-overview/web-interface/app-platform" >}})
- [Inspect permissions]({{< relref "/vintage/platform-overview/web-interface/permissions" >}})

## Usage data recording

Learn [what data is recorded for what purpose]({{< relref "/vintage/platform-overview/web-interface/usage-data" >}}) when using the web interface.

## Source code

Our web interface is Open Source software. Find the code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa).

## Feedback {#feedback}

We welcome your feedback on our web interface. If you feel like sharing openly, use the GitHub repository and create an [issue](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/issues), so other users can participate. Otherwise please use the common Giant Swarm support channels.
