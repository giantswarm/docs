The Giant Swarm applications use a defaulting and validation logic for the [`App` custom resources]({{< relref "/reference/platform-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io.md" >}}) to enhance the user experience and prevent common mistakes.

This logic is provided by [`app-admission-controller`](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-admission-controller). When you create or update an `App` resource, the controller will ensure that the resource is correctly configured and will default some fields based on the cluster configuration.

## Defaulting

The defaulting logic is implemented using a [mutating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook). It currently defaults the following settings in the `App` resource if they're not specified.

- The `app-operator.giantswarm.io/version` label - It determines which instance of app operator processes the `App` resource. The value is set based on the release version of the cluster.
- The cluster values `ConfigMap` - It contains per cluster values like the base domain for your cluster.
- The `kubeconfig` `Secret` - It lets app operator connect to your cluster.

In the following example, there is an `App` resource only with the basic settings you need to provide. The user values `ConfigMap` is optional, in case you wish to configure the app with your own values.

```yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-kong
  namespace: x7jwz
spec:
  catalog: giantswarm
  name: kong-app
  namespace: kong
  version: 0.7.2
  userConfig:
    configMap:
      name: kong-user-values
      namespace: x7jwz
```

Next is the `App` resource with the defaults added by the mutating webhook.

```yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-kong
  namespace: x7jwz
  labels:
    app-operator.giantswarm.io/version: 3.0.0
spec:
  catalog: giantswarm
  name: kong-app
  namespace: kong
  version: 0.7.2
  config:
    configMap:
      name: x7jwz-cluster-values
      namespace: x7jwz
  kubeConfig:
    context:
      name: x7jwz
    inCluster: false
    secret:
      name: x7jwz-kubeconfig
      namespace: x7jwz
  userConfig:
    configMap:
      name: kong-user-values
      namespace: x7jwz
```

## Validation

The validation logic is implemented using a [validating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook). It checks for common problems with `App` resources.

Currently we validate:

- The `app-operator.giantswarm.io/version` label is present.
- All referenced `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` exist.
- The catalog has a matching `Catalog` custom resource.
- There is no `App` resource with a conflicting annotation or label value for the [target namespace]({{< relref "/tutorials/fleet-management/app-platform/namespace-configuration" >}}).

If app operator finds a matching [`AppCatalogEntry`]({{< relref "/reference/platform-api/crd/appcatalogentries.application.giantswarm.io.md" >}}) custom resource, it will use this to run more validation checks.

- Cloud provider compatibility (For example you canâ€™t install the `azure-ad-pod-identity` app in AWS cluster).
- Namespace restriction (cluster singleton, namespace singleton, fixed namespace).

## Skipping configuration validation

If you are managing your `App` resource by the means of a third party tool (for example `flux`) then the
validating webhook may block creation of the `App` resource if it's created before the referenced `ConfigMap` or `Secret`.

To prevent this you can add the label `giantswarm.io/managed-by` and set the value to the tool you're using for example `flux` or `helm`. If you aren't using a particular tool to deploy your resources but find the validation blocking you, you may also set this to some other value, for example `external`, to allow your custom resource to be created regardless. See example below, note, some fields have been removed for brevity.

```yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: w0xyz
  labels:
    giantswarm.io/managed-by: flux
spec:
  userConfig:
    configMap:
      name: my-app-userconfig
      namespace: w0xyz
```

The `app-admission-controller` will now allow the `App` resource to be created despite the referenced `my-app-userconfig` doesn't exist. The app operator will still perform the validation checks and once the referenced `ConfigMap` or `Secret` exists the app will be installed.

## Retry Logic

During cluster creation there can a short delay while the `kubeconfig` `Secret` and cluster values `ConfigMap` are generated.

So if you have an automated process for creating `App` resources please ensure it retries till the infrastructure is provisioned.
