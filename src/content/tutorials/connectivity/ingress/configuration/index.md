To integrate the "Nginx configuration summary" into the existing document, let's maintain the structure and style of the current content. I'll fit this new information in its appropriate position.

## Nginx Configuration Summary

The ingress nginx controller offers a range of configuration options that allow you to customize its behavior extensively. Below is a summary of some important configurations available for Nginx in the context of ingress usage.

### Default Nginx Settings

The default settings for Nginx within the ingress controller are focused on common use cases, ensuring optimal performance, security, and reliability for your applications.

### Customizing Nginx

You can customize Nginx configurations to fit specific needs. This is achieved using _configuration snippets_ or through the global `ingress-nginx-user-values` ConfigMap on the management cluster.

### Core Nginx Features

- **SSL Termination**: Easily manage SSL termination by configuring ingress resources to use either passthrough or termination at the ingress level.
- **Path-Based Routing**: Efficiently route requests to different backend services based on URL paths.
- **Rate Limiting**: Mitigate potential DDoS threats by setting up connection and request per second (RPS) limitations on inbound requests.

### Advanced Features

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Integrate ModSecurity as a defense mechanism against common security threats.
- **Session Affinity**: Ensure consistent backend selection during a user's session by implementing sticky sessions.
  
### Configuration Tips

- **Headers and Rewrites**: Modify request headers and utilize rewrite rules to ensure correct routing and backend communication.
- **CORS and Security Headers**: Use Nginx's powerful header management capabilities to enforce CORS policies and other security headers.

By leveraging these comprehensive configurations, you can finely tune your ingress controller to meet a wide array of networking needs.
