### Nginx Configuration Summary

This section provides a summary of the key Nginx configuration options available in the ingress nginx controller, allowing you to optimize your Kubernetes environment effectively.

- **Per-Service Options**: Customize specific services via annotations in the ingress YAML definition, enabling granular control over routing and service management.
- **Global Cluster Options**: Modify global settings for all ingresses in a cluster through ConfigMaps, offering centralized management of configurations like SSL enforcement and security settings.

### Key Features

- **TLS Configuration**: Choose between SSL passthrough or termination at the ingress controller, providing flexibility in managing encrypted traffic to your services.
- **Rate Limiting**: Use annotations to limit connections and requests per second (RPS), helping to mitigate DDoS attacks and manage resource utilization efficiently.
- **Session Affinity**: Ensure session persistence using 'cookie' or 'ip_hash' methods, facilitating continuous user sessions and reducing load on backend services.

### Security Enhancements

- **ModSecurity Integration**: Enable this Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against malicious requests. Start with detection mode to fine-tune settings before activating blocking mode for increased security.
- **Customizable Headers and Snippets**: Employ configuration snippets in Nginx to add headers or modify requests/responses, providing the flexibility to meet specific security and performance requirements.
