Nginx configuration summary

The Nginx ingress controller offers a range of configurations ensuring tailored ingress management for your applications. Below is a concise Nginx configuration summary to help you navigate key settings effectively.

### Key Configurations

- **Microservices Routing**: Simplify microservices-based architectures by routing requests using path-based or hostname-based rules.
- **TLS Management**: Efficiently manage TLS encryption with options for SSL passthrough or termination at the ingress layer.
- **Authentication**: Enforce security using either Basic or Digest Access Authentication.
- **Rate Limiting**: Mitigate DDoS attacks via connection and request-per-second limitations.
- **Session Affinity**: Ensure stable application performance with sticky sessions, redirecting specific user sessions to consistent backend services.
- **CORS Handling**: Enable CORS headers using annotations to support cross-origin requests.
- **ModSecurity WAF Support**: Implement robust security measures with Web Application Firewall capabilities.

### Example Annotations

To customize your ingress rules further, use the following annotations:

- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type`: Configures authentication type needed for accessing the service.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors`: Enables CORS for specified paths.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps`: Restricts the number of requests per second from a single IP.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size`: Sets the maximum body size for requests, preventing excessive loads.

### Advanced Features

- **Configuration Snippets**: Integrate custom Nginx configuration snippets directly into your ingress resource definitions.
- **Custom Timeout Settings**: Adjust upstream and client timeout values, optimizing response stability.
- **Dynamic Configuration Updates**: Utilize ConfigMaps to update global settings dynamically across your cluster.

For in-depth configuration settings and examples, refer to the [ingress nginx controller documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/).
