### Removed
- Removed the `--region` flag from the `kubectl-gs template` commands. Region gets set automatically according to the installation the cluster is created in.
### Added
- Added the `validate apps` command for validating the values of apps against the `values.schema.json` in their chart, or against a `values.schema.json` locally via a path provided through the command line.
