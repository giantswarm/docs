### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `login` command where the `issuer` URL was used instead of the `server` address in login retry attempt.
### Added
- Add flags `--gcp-machine-deployment-sa-email` and `--gcp-machine-deployment-sa-scopes` to `template cluster` that specify a Google Cloud Platform service account and its scope to a cluster's machine deployments
- Added read header timeout to http server
### Changed
- Adjusted `kubectl gs login` command to ensure that it writes to the main kubeconfig file only in case there are actual changes in the content of the file.
