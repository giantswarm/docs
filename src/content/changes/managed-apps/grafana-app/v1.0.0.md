### Changed
- Upgrade upstream chart from version 6.24.1 to 6.31.0, and grafana from 8.4.2 to 9.0.1. This release includes a small set of breaking changes that you can check [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-9-0-0/#breaking-changes).
This release also allows some existing values to be templetized (tpl function) and adds a bit more configurability options (e.g. network policies)
