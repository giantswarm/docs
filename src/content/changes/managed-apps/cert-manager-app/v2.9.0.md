### Changed
- Update to upstream `v1.4.2` ([#174](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/174)). This deprecates `v1alpha2`, `v1alpha3` and `v1beta1` versions of `cert-manager.io` and `acme.cert-manager.io` CRDs. Further information can be found in the [upstream release notes](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-1.4/) of cert-manager.
- Increase resource requests for the ClusterIssuer and CRD installation Jobs ([#174](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/174)) to prevent timeouts.
