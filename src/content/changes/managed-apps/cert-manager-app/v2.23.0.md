### Changed
- Update container image versions to use v1.12.1 ([#323](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/323))
- Do not try to install PodSecurityPolicies if not available. This will make the Chart compatible with kubernetes >= 1.25 ([#321](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/321))
- Change security contexts to make the chart work with PSS restricted profile ([#324](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/324)
