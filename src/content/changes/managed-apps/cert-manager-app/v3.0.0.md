⚠️ Attention: This major release contains breaking changes in user values! ⚠️
We decided to move the helm chart code moves closer to upstream. This means we're pulling in the [helm chart templates from the cert-manager repository](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/tree/master/deploy/charts/cert-manager) and applying changes to ensure best compatibility to the Giant Swarm clusters.
This results in some breaking changes in the chart values. Please review the [upgrade guide](./docs/upgrading.md) to see if you're affected.
### Changed
- We aligned the chart templates to the [upstream cert-manager chart v1.12.2](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/tree/master/deploy/charts/cert-manager). Please review the [upgrade guide](./docs/upgrading.md). ([#316](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/316))
