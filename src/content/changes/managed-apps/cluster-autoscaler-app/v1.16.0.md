title: cluster-autoscaler-app Release v1.16.0
---

Note that with this release we start to align the versioning scheme to the upstream project, so our v1.16.x represents upstream v1.16.x.
### Changed
- Use cluster-autoscaler version v1.16.5.
  - This version introduces a new method to read AWS EC2 instance type details from an AWS API. Since this API is not reachable from the AWS China regions, the autoscaler is started with the `--aws-use-static-instance-list=true` flag.
- Set `scan-interval` to 30 seconds (from 10 seconds) to save resources.
- Set `scale-down-unneeded-time` to 5 minutes (from the default of 10 minutes) to release unneeded nodes earlier.
- Lower `scaleDownUtilizationThreshold` to 0.5.
