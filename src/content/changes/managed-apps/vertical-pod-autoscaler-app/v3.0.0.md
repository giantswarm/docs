### Added
- Add cilium network policy so that the crd-install job can reach the k8s api to install the CRDs.
- README: doc improvements
### Changed
- Remove `push-to-app-collection` jobs for onprem providers since this app became a part of default apps bundle.
- Moved to chart dependency
- âš  Major upgrade, breaking changes
  - values structure changes. We rely on a subchart, meaning all of previous setup goes to a `vertical-pod-autoscaler` section
  - the upstream repo has changed and thus as did the helm chart config
  - for more detailed explanations, check the README
