### Announcements
- **Important: the `latest` tag alias is being removed.** Some users have reported issues using the `latest` tag on our hosted registries (Docker Hub, Quay, etc.). We advise against using `latest` tags and don't use them ourselves, so this tag is not kept up to date. Please switch to using a tagged version. We will be removing the `latest` tag from our public registries in the near future to avoid confusion.
### Added
- Add missing monitoring options in the Helm chart values.yaml.
- Support sharding report metrics across multiple instances of the exporter.
- Set `runAsNonRoot` and use `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile.
- Make replica count configurable in Helm values.
- Add configurable tolerations to Helm values.
- Reconcile and expose metrics for `CISKubeBenchReport` custom resources.
