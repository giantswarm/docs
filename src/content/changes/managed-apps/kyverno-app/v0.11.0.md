### Changed
- Update `kyverno` to upstream version 1.7.2 / chart version 2.5.2.
- Use pre-install CRD install Job to remove storage version `v1alpha1` for several Kyverno CRDs.
- Set Kyverno to use the `giantswarm-critical` PriorityClass.
- Limit maximum ReportChangeRequests per namespace to 100.
- Split PolicyReports into one report per policy to support the RCR limiting and avoid cases where a report doesn't fit into etcd.
