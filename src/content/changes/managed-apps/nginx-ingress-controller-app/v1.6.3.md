### Changed
- Adjust resource requests, HPA and PDB depending on determined cluster profile; supported cluster profiles include xxs, xs, small, and larger than small or unknown. ([#38](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/38))
  By default, for nginx on:
  - xxs clusters - clear resource requests, HPA and PDB are disabled
  - xs clusters - clear resource requests, enabled HPA and PDB
  - small clusters - have some resource requests, HPA and PDB are enabled
  - clusters larger than small or unknown - have decent resource requests i.e. capacity out-of-the-box, and HPA and PDB are enabled.
