### Changed
- Update controller container image to [`v0.48.1`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v0.48.1). ([#211](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/211)). This release contains several performance improvements related to the admission webhook.
- Breaking: Define `--disable-svc-external-name` flag by default to disable forwarding traffic to [ExternalName Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname). If you require this feature, you can enable forwarding again through setting `controller.disableExternalNameForwarding: false` in user values. ([#211](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/211))
