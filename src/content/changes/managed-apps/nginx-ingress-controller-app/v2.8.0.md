title: nginx-ingress-controller-app release v2.8.0
---

This release contains a potential breaking change in case you are using and relying on the configuration setting [`use-forwarded-headers`](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#use-forwarded-headers). From now on the default value will change to `false`. In case you're relying on this feature, you'll need override this in your customized values like this:
    configmap:
        use-forwarded-headers: "true"
### Changed
- Push chart to control plane catalog.
- Disable `use-forwarded-headers` by default.
