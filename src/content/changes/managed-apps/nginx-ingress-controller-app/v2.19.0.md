---

### Added
- Add support to create internal Load Balancers on GCP.
### Changed
- Update controller container image to [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/Changelog.md#140). ([#353](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/353))
### Removed
- Disable `PodSecurityPolicy` for Kubernetes >= v1.25. ([#352](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/352))
### Important notes
Please upgrade to any `v2.18.x` version before upgrading to this release or above since the controller image contained in there migrates your setup to the Lease API.
Additionally the controller version included in this release deprecates some metric names and introduces others as a replacement. See [this PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/8728) and [the upstream docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/controller-v1.4.0/docs/user-guide/monitoring.md#exposed-metrics) for more details.
