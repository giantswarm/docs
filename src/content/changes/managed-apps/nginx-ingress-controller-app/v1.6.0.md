### Changed
- Upgrade to nginx-ingress-controller 0.30.0. ([#31](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/31))
- Configured app icon. ([#32](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/32))
- Enabled HorizontalPodAutoscaler by default. ([#27](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/27))
- Based on HPA trials done so far, following settings have been adjusted to better fit actual observed usage profiles:
  - CPU resource requests have been adjusted from 500m to 2 CPU
    - 0.5 CPU was not enough for all the processes NGINX Ingress Controller starts
  - Memory requests changed from 600Mi to 2.5GB
    - Scaling out does not shard Ingress definitions and other configurations stored in memory of every nginx-ingress-controller replica
    - Memory usage spikes during configuration reloads
    - It improves the HPA stability
  - Default number of nginx worker processes was changed from 4 to 1
    - This reduced memory usage of each replica
    - It didn't affect request handling capacity
    - Better defaults considering CPU requests and number of processes running on every nginx-ingress-controller replica.
- To avoid cluster-operator and HPA collision and nginx service disruption, this release also breaks with cluster-operator controllable nginx ingress controller Deployment replicas count
  - `ingressController.replicas` which was previously dynamically set by cluster-operator is now removed
  - New `controller.replicaCount` config property is introduced, default replica count is set to 1, and then by default enabled HPA takes it over from there, by default scaling the Deployment in range of 1 to 20 replicas
  - If HPA gets disabled on-demand, replica count will stay static if not manually or automatically changed by some third party.
