### Changed
- Default `max-worker-connections` to `0`, making it same as `max-worker-open-files` i.e. `max open files (system's limit) / worker-processes - 1024`.
  This optimizes for high load conditions where it improves performance at the cost of increasing RAM utilization (even on idle).
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler was tuned to use `targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage` of `80` due to increased RAM utilization with new default for `max-worker-connections` of `0`.
- Removed use of `enable-dynamic-certificates` CLI flag, it has been deprecated since [ingress-nginx 0.26.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/Changelog.md#0260) via [ingress-nginx PR #4356](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/4356)
- Changed default `error-log-level` from `error` to `notice`.
- Added a link to the README in the sources of Chart.yaml
