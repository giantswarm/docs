This release contains a breaking change introduced by a change to the `spec.controller` value of the `IngressClass` installed by this Helm chart.
Before upgrading to this version, you'll need to manually delete the `IngressClass` managed by this Helm chart.
```
kubectl delete ingressclass <class name, "kong" by default>
```
