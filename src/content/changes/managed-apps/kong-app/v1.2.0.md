### IMPORTANT
>1.15.0 is an interim release before the planned release of 2.0.0. There were
several feature changes we wanted to release prior to the removal of deprecated
functionality for 2.0. The original planned deprecations covered in the [1.14.0
changelog](#1140) are still planned for 2.0.0.
This update bundles all changes since upstream chart version [1.12.0](https://github.com/Kong/charts/tree/kong-1.12.0)
Make sure to review the upstream [changelog](helm/kong-app/CHANGELOG.md) and the [upgrade documentation](helm/kong-app/UPGRADE.md).
### Updates
- architect-orb 0.18.1 --> 2.1.0
- Kong 2.2 --> 2.3
- upstream chart 1.12.0 --> 1.15.0
See [upgrade documentation](helm/kong-app/UPGRADE.md) for detailed list of changes and improvements.
