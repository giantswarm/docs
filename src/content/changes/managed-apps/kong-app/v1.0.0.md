### Breaking changes
* Kong Ingress Controller 1.0 removes support for several deprecated flags and
  the KongCredential custom resource. Please see the [controller changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes)
  for details. Note that Helm 3 will not remove the KongCredential CRD by
  default: you should delete it manually after converting KongCredentials to
  [credential Secrets](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/next/docs/guides/using-consumer-credential-resource.md#provision-a-consumer).
  If you manage CRDs using Helm (check to see if your KongCredential CRD has a
  `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm` label), perform the credential Secret
  conversion **before** upgrading to chart 1.11.0 to avoid losing credential
  configuration.
* The chart no longer uses the `extensions` API for PodSecurityPolicy, and now
  uses the modern `policy` API. This breaks compatibility with Kubernetes
  versions 1.11 and older.
  ([#195](https://github.com/Kong/charts/pull/195))
