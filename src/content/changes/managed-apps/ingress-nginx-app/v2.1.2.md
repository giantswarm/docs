### Changed
- Disallow the controller Ingress to parse and add *-snippet annotations/directives created by the user. This can be changed by setting `controller.enableSnippetDirectives` to `true`.
  We recommend enabling this option only if you TRUST users with permission to create Ingress objects, as this may allow a user to add restricted configurations to the final nginx.conf file.
  This is a mitigation against CVE-2021-25742.
  ([#237](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/pull/237))
