### Fixed
- Work around a Helm issue when `null` is used in the default values file. This caused problems with upgrades in some scenarious.
- Add a configurable workaround to [clean up leftover lock files on NFS storage](https://github.com/giantswarm/efk-stack-app/blob/master/README.md#running-on-nfs).
