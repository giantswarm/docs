title: loki-app release v0.5.0
---

### Changed
- Changed upstream chart, from loki-distributed to standard loki (former simple-scalable) - Switching from unsupported community chart to loki-supported *official chart*.
- Upgrade Loki from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1
- ⚠️  Major upgrade, [breaking changes](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/blob/master/README.md#from-04x-to-05x)
  - PVCs change as we switch from distributed (ingester, compactor, distributor...) to simple-scalable (just read and write pods)
  - values structure changes. We rely on a subchart, meaning most of previous setup goes to a `loki` section. See example files for extra info.
### Fixed
- Azure sample config file: storage setup
- Sample config files: placement for compactor
