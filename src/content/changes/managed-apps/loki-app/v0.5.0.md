title: loki-app release v0.5.0
---

### Changed
- Changed upstream chart, from loki-distributed to standard loki (former simple-scalable)
- Upgrade Loki from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1
- ⚠️  Major upgrade, breaking changes
  - PVCs change as we switch from distributed (ingester, compactor, distributor...) to simple-scalable (just read and write pods)
  - values structure changes. We rely on a subchart, meaning most of previous setup goes to a `loki` section. See example files for extra info.
  - see (UPGRADE.md)[https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/blob/release-v0.5.x/UPGRADE.md#procedure-to-upgrade-from-loki-app-v04x-to-v05x] for more info on how to upgrade
### Fixed
- Azure sample config file: storage setup
- Sample config files: placement for compactor
