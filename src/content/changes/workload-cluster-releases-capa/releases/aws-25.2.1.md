This release introduces several changes that are required for Vintage to CAPA migration use-cases.

Most notable change is that now `auditd` is *disabled* by default. If you actively use this feature, please add the following field `global.components.auditd.enabled` set to `true` in the Cluster App user values before the upgrade.
