### Changes

- The cluster detail page has recieved some structural changes to improve readability
  - The SCALE button has been removed from top right. Instead you can click on 'Edit' in the "Worker Node Scaling" row
  - Add vertical spacing to table rows to make table easier to read
  - Remove top spacing and border form details table
  - Regroup items to have the (unchangeable) VM size / instance type further in the top, above the dynamic details.
  - Add details to instance type / VM size info
- The rendering of the Organizations column in the key pairs table has been improved for better readability
- The scaling modal has been cleaned up and now better matches the situation we have since the introduction of autoscaling.

### Bugfixes

- The sorting of the keypair table is back to what it used to be (reverse chronological)
- Happa transitions more smoothly between it's breakpoints now, allowing it to stay at a larger
width for longer.
