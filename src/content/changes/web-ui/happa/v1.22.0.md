## Added

- In the cluster overview, we added the number of apps to be upgraded ([#2790](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2790))
- On Azure, node pools using the API version `v1alpha4` resources of type `MachinePool` and `AzureMachinePool` can now be displayed. This brings us closer to supporting Cluster API (CAPZ) clusters. Note that creating, updating and deleting are not yet supported. ([#2787](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2787))

These additions are only available to users authenticating via single sign-on (SSO).
