## Changed

- Deleting an organization has become much simpler, right from the organization details page. We also give more explanation win case it's currently not possible to delete, e. g. because there are still clusters running. ([#1983](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1983))

## Fixed

- When upgrading a tenant cluster to a newer release, it is now possible to skip several minor versions. You can access this via the release details dialog by clicking the tenant cluster release version on the cluster details page.  ([#1988](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1988))
- When installing an app in a tenant cluster from the cluster details page, the pre-selection of the cluster to install to is now working as expected. ([#1987](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1987))
- The `Release notes` link in the footer now points to the actual URL. Really. ([#1986](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1986))
