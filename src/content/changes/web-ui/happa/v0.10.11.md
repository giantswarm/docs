## New Features

- When viewing a cluster that does not come with a preinstalled ingress we now show a message explaining why and include a link to get more information. ([#1079](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1079))

## Changes

- We've made a change to avoid showing the upgrade available message for incompatible version jumps on AWS. ([#1083](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1083))
- The names of node pools are now truncated only if there is not enough space to display them ([#1084](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1084))
- The kubeconfigs generated when creating a keypair are now aligned with what gsctl produces. They now have cluster specific values for the name, username, and context fields ([#1073](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1073))

## Bug Fixes

- Improve how we deal with clusters that have been deleted. ([#1086](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1086))
- Fixed certain issues on the cluster detail page ([#1082](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1082), [#1062](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1062), [#1059](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1059))
- Fixed invite modal logic ([#1072](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1072)) (This is relevant only to Giant Swarm staff, customers are not able to invite users)
- Reduce the number of api calls made when switching organizations ([#1060](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1060))

## Dev changes / Refactorings

- Produce node pools to selector ([#1061](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1061))
- Refactor OAuthCallback route into function component ([#1076](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1076))

**Note:** We've started adding `v` to our tags, because that is the recommended practice and how other repos throughout Giant Swarm do it too!
