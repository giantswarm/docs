## Changed

- Happa now has a configurable timeout for network requests. We've adjusted timeouts on some installations where requests can take long. ([#1414](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1414))
- Go to the app tab of a cluster's detail page after installing app ([#1400](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1400))
- Show a more appropriate error for certain cases of app creation failure. ([#1401](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1401))
- Open changelog links in new tab ([#1399](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1399))

## Fixed

- Updated the kubectl prompt output for the getting started example, it was a bit outdated. ([#1393](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1393))
- Fixed the wrong error being propagated through Happa when a request fails after refreshing the token.  ([#1402](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1402))
