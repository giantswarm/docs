## Changes
- We now only fetch details for clusters that are currently in view. Improving
the load on our backend. ([#882](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/882))

- The cluster detail view now redirects to the cluster list when the cluster you are 
viewing is no longer able to be found, for example when someone else deletes it. ([#815](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/815))

- We've replaced a warning mentioning that we do not support or monitor clusters 
below three worker nodes (which is not the case) with a recommendation to have 
at least three worker nodes. ([#865](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/865))

## Bugfixes
- We're no longer show pre-installed apps in the list of apps when viewing a cluster.
This list is meant to show only the apps that you have installed yourself. ([#871](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/871))

## Dev Changes 
We're adding stricter linting and continue to improve the codebase consistency
on various fronts.
