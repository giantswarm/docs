## Changed

- When using single sign-on, app catalogs are now fetched from the Management API, which results in a drastic performance improvement. Also the "Helm stable" catalog is no longer offered. ([#2654](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2654))
- In the cluster details page, we renamed the label "Control plane nodes" to "Control plane" to make it fit both high-availability control planes and such with a single node alike. ([#2657](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2657))

## Fixed

- We fixed a little glitch in the button allowing you to upgrade happa, and also increased the contrast for better readability. ([#2655](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2655))
