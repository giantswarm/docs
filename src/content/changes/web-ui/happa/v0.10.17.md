## Added

There have been some additions regarding the App Catalog and Apps in general:

- We added a way to edit the version of an installed app. ([#1227](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1227), [#1212](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1212))
- We've also added a version picker during app installation, so you can now pick the version of the app that you want to install ([#1202](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1202))
- There is now a table that shows chart versions and what app versions they will install when viewing an app from the App Catalog ([#1200](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1200))
- Add lastly, we've added `kiam` and `external-dns` to the list of preinstalled apps on clusters that indeed have these apps ([#1197](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1197))

We've also made upgrade availability information more visible in more places:

- We've added an upgrade notice in the clusters list, so you can see at a glance which clusters are eligible for an upgrade ([#1204](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1204))
- Similar to the above, we've also added an upgrade available icon in the list of clusters on the organisation detail page ([#1208](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1208))


## Changed

- Some modals could stay open even when changing routes. We now make sure modals close when the route changes ([#1211](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1211))
- We now ensure that the organization provider credentials form closes when you leave the page ([#1209](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1209))

## Fixed

- We fixed a memory leak in the app installation form ([#1210](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1210))
- We now ensure that the upgrade cluster modal does not re-render unnecessarily after dispatching an action ([#1233](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1233))
- Check cluster existence in dashboard resources component to avoid some potential error cases ([#1230](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1230))
- We fixed a bug where clusters would be created in the currently selected organization, instead of the organization you clicked "create cluster" in ([#1207](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1207))
- And lastly, we fixed an issue triggering the update cluster modal ([#1206](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1206))

## Development changes / refactorings

- Change appReducer to mainReducer ([#1228](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1228))
- Create custom response object ([#1226](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1226))
- Return empty array if no cluster in selectClusterNodePools ([#1231](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1231))
- Refactor keypair test and fix overloaded action type. ([#1223](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1223))
- Write tests and comments for the new model layer ([#1203](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1203))
