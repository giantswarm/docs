## What's changed

- Terminology change for alignment with the Kubernetes project: What was called a "master node" is now called a "control plane node". "High-availability masters" is now called "High-availability control plane".  ([#2505](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2505))
- Our real user monitoring now records every URL seen in the web UI, to help us understand better how you use it. Previously only a subset of URLs was recorded. ([#2506](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2506))
- a few smaller changes
