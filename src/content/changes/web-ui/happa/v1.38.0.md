### Changes

* The top navigation, organization selection, and user menu have been improved to work in much more narrow viewports. This will simplify the use on a mobile device as well as in a narrow browser window. By @gusevda in https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/3257
* In the Apps section within the cluster details page, we fixed a glitch where the version selection dropdown content got masked by the main header. By @gusevda in https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/3260
