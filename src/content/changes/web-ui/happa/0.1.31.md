Exciting times! New features are coming to Happa and we want a way to keep you informed. Up until now we haven't really officially versioned Happa or kept a change log. That's changing now. We've added a footer to happa that shows the current version as well as a link to this very page you are on now.

### Changes

- Added a footer with version number and a link to these release notes.
- We've added icons to most of the buttons in Happa
- The Getting Started guide is no longer a top level navigation item.
- Organizations are now a top level navigation item.
- The 'Access' button has been renamed to 'Get Started' since it always linked to the get started guide for that cluster.
- Various cosmetic and rendering bug fixes
