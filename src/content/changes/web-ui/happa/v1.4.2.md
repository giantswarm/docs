## What's changed
- We're continuing to migrate our inputs and controls over to the Grommet component framework. This should not have any impact on usage. Instead it should improve the usability and accessibility of those controls. ([#2188](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2188), [#2183](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2183), [#2187](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2187))

## Fixed
- Fixed a crash if an error occurs while loading a catalog ([#2192](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2192))

## Dev changes
- Update multiple dependencies ([#2198](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2198))
- Fixed some warnings and errors in our test suite ([#2174](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2174))
