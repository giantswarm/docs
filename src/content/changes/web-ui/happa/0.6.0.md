### Changes

- We overhauled the key pairs table to show more of the most important information, moving less important details like description and ID into a details dialog. Certificate organization names (the `O` field of the certificate) will be color-coded using a hash function, so each org name will be displayed in a unique color. ([#573](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/573))
