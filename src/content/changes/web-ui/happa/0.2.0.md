### Changes

- Most information shown on the cluster details page is now refreshed automatically. No more need for `Ctrl+R`/ `Cmd+R`.

We plan to auto-refresh information in more places in the future. As it's an exception for now, we mark it clearly in the UI and also tag it with `BETA`. We are particularly interested in your feedback. Please let us know via your Slack support channel if you notice anything unexpected.
