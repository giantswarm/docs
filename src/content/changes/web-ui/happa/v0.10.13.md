## Added

- In preparation of an upcoming Giant Swarm release, we have added support for picking Availability Zones when creating Azure clusters. (#899)

## Changed
- We now wait till we are sure the cluster delete request succeeded before redirecting to the organisation page (#1099)

- We've added a "Nodes not ready yet" message to the node count when a cluster is new, instead of showing `0 Nodes` which might be a bit confusing. (#1137, #1103, #1141, #1108, #1129, #1128)
- Change the error message when Happa fails to fetch or process releases(#1127, #1122)

## Fixed
- Temporary fix for last updated label (#1116)
- Fixed a flash of content in the v4 cluster details views (#1143)
- We fixed an authentication issue with the User invite feature (only available to Giant Swarm staff at the moment). It was using the old JWT token instead of a new one after the token got stale. (#1089)

## Dev changes / Refactorings
- Added tests for app installation and editing (#1120)
- Update production build (#1130)
- Adapt Happa to use new error/loading reducers in clusterReducer and cluster views (#1109)
- Write integration test for the OAuth admin login user flow (#1106)
- Write integration test for the Sign Up user flow (#1102)

- Add error reducer (#1100)
- Add entity error reducer and ErrorFallback component (#1101)
- Entity loading reducer (#1125)
