---

## Added

- In preparation of an upcoming Giant Swarm release, we have added support for picking Availability Zones when creating Azure clusters. ([#899](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/899))

## Changed
- We now wait till we are sure the cluster delete request succeeded before redirecting to the organization page ([#1099](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1099))

- We've added a "Nodes not ready yet" message to the node count when a cluster is new, instead of showing `0 Nodes` which might be a bit confusing. ([#1137](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1137), [#1103](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1103), [#1141](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1141), [#1108](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1108), [#1129](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1129), [#1128](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1128))
- Change the error message when Happa fails to fetch or process releases([#1127](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1127), [#1122](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1122))

## Fixed
- Temporary fix for last updated label ([#1116](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1116))
- Fixed a flash of content in the v4 cluster details views ([#1143](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1143))
- We fixed an authentication issue with the User invite feature (only available to Giant Swarm staff at the moment). It was using the old JWT token instead of a new one after the token got stale. ([#1089](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1089))

## Dev changes / Refactorings
- Added tests for app installation and editing ([#1120](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1120))
- Update production build ([#1130](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1130))
- Adapt Happa to use new error/loading reducers in clusterReducer and cluster views ([#1109](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1109))
- Write integration test for the OAuth admin login user flow ([#1106](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1106))
- Write integration test for the Sign Up user flow ([#1102](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1102))
- Change ErrorFallback so that it accepts an array ([#1104](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1104))
- Add error reducer ([#1100](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1100))
- Add entity error reducer and ErrorFallback component ([#1101](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1101))
- Entity loading reducer ([#1125](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1125))
- Remove deleted cluster from calls in batchedRefreshClusters ([#1138](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1138))
- Fix capabilities not being injected during the deployment process ([#1148](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1148))
