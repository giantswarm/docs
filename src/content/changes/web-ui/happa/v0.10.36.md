## What's changed

Cluster upgrades from within happa has been made safer. It is no longer possible to upgrade non-ready clusters. Also, an upgrade indicator will be displayed for upgrades in progress from this version on. ([#1697](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1697))

### Bugfixes

Cluster creation would show empty rows in the release selection table. This won't happen again for now. ([#1708](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1708))

### Internal changes

Cluster detail styles have been ported to use styled components ([#1712](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1712))
