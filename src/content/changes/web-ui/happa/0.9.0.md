### New Features

The Giant Swarm App Catalog is being rolled out and this release brings various features that enable you to browse App Catalogs aswell as Install and Manage Apps. 

If you are keeping an eager eye on this releases page, you might not see the App Catalog yet in your installation, but don't be disappointed, it's behind a feature flag. We'll be rolling it out as soon as possible to all installations. Keep an eye on your slack channels.

### Changes

The changelog shown when upgrading your cluster now groups its lines by component for a better overview of what is changing. It also supports markdown now, so that we can format these lines in a nicer way.
