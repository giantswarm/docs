### Changes

- In cluster creation, the release selection has moved up, right after the cluster name. This fits better with the mechanics, as the release selected influences some of the settings available further down. https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/524
- In the cluster overview, hide the `Get Started` button if the cluster is older than 30 days. Note that the link is still available from the cluster details page, regardless of the age. https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/525

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a rendering issue for disabled number input fields on Firefox. https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/523
