### Changes

We improved the form and flow for creating a new Cluster API workload cluster. When configuring the new cluster, you now have the option to **select the cluster app version to use**, which will influence e. g. the Kubernetes version. You also have the option to **copy or download your configuration** to use it in GitOps or in a CLI, instead of/in addition to creating the cluster directly. Last not least, you will now see **more detailed progress information** when actually creating the cluster.
