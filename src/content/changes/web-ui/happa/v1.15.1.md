## What's changed

With this release we are adding more Management API guides, this time around creating and listing clusters. In addition, we worked on some minor user experience improvements.

## Added

- Add Management API/CLI guides for the clusters page (home) and the cluster details "Overview" tab ([#2619](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2619))

## Changed

- Organization access control for single sign-on users: improve service account action success messages ([#2627](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2627)), sort roles list by (cluster) role name ([#2637](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2637)), turn of spell-checking for subject name input ([#2621](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2621)), improve deletion confirmation prompt for deleting service account subjects ([#2618](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2618))
- Don't display tooltips with the full date on relative dates like "3 days ago" when they are not needed ([#2614](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2614))

## Fixed

- Fix cluster details page - Subscription ID sometimes not appearing ([#2609](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2609))
