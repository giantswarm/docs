### Fixes
- The `sed` command that is part of our getting started guide didn't work for linux users. The guide now features an appropriate command for linux users, and some helpful hints for those on windows.

### Changes

- The key pair detail modal now shows the relative date for creation as well as expiration
- We're now hiding the availability zone selector during cluster creation on Azure and KVM installations, since this option has no impact here.

### Other

We've done a lot of ground work for the app catalog, this new feature is currently in testing and available only on certain installations.
