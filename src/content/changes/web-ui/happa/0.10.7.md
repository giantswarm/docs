title: happa Release v0.10.7
---

Greetings fellow Happa users and Happa followers. It is now possible to set an App's secret while installing it! Before this, it was possible to upload a secret for an app, but only after creating it. That meant you'd potentially have a misconfigured app for a moment, which isn't ideal. Now the install app modal contains a field for uploading your Secrets file too!

Other than that, Happa 0.10.7 brings quite a lot of behind the scenes development work to the table. 

We've discussed internally the future of Happa's codebase extensively, and these decisions are starting to be implemented and are now finding their way into the codebase.

## Changes:
  - It is now also possible to supply a secret when creating an app ([#877](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/877))

## Bugfixes:
  - Fixed an issue when editing node pool names regarding truncation ([#969](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/969))
  - Fixed the CPU and RAM label showing "0" when loading a 'v4' cluster. ([#970](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/970))
  - Fixed a bug when loading keypairs ([#985](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/985))
  - Fixed an infinite loop that could occur in the availability zone component ([#992](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/992))
