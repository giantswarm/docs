## Changes
- Instead of waiting for all requests to finish, we render the cluster overview 
immediately with some placeholders for things like CPU, RAM, Nodecount. ([#1048](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1048), [#1036](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1036))

instance type ([#1058](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1058))
