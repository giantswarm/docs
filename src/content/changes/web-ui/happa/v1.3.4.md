Hello reader!

This release contains mostly codebase refactoring as we prepare to organise our components better.

## Changes
- Slight visual tweaks to buttons throughout all parts of the Web UI. The "Large" button styling has been removed. Small buttons in table rows have had their padding and font sizes reduced.

## Dev Changes
- Organize UI components into folders ([#2054](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2054))
- Fence in the Button, consolidate the styles, replace 'large' buttons ([#2053](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/2053))
