### Changes

* If an app installed in a workload cluster is named different than the app's name in the catalog, we now display the App resource name in the list of installed apps, too. By @gusevda in https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/3611
* We removed the misleading warning that appeared in the cluster upgrade modal for clusters with high-availability control planes regarding the API becoming unavailable during an upgrade. This warning now only appears in case there is a single control plane node. By @gusevda in https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/3628
