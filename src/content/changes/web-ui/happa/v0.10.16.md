## Fixed

- Fixed an infinite loading spinner issue when opening Happa. (We had to add support for 'giantswarm' authorization schemes in a new client we introduced while refactoring) ([#1195](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1195))

## Changed

- Remove an exclamation mark from the app detail pane in the cluster detail page. ([#1194](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1194))
