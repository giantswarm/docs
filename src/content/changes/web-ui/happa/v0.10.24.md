- We now use tabs in the app detail view, moving the chart versions to a different tab. ([#1366](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1366))
- We also hide most chart versions now, but make them expandable. ([#1351](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1351))

- Since keypairs are non revokable, we now display a warning if you try to create a keypair with a TTL > 30 days ([#1343](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/pull/1343))
