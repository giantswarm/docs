title: Workload cluster release aws-25.5.0 for CAPA
---

Most notable change in this release is the reduction of IAM permissions on the worker nodes instance profile, aiming at improving the general security of the clusters. Additional changes include reducing the size of the ETCD volume to 50GB targetting costs saving initiatives, improvements for the `node-termination-handler` application for smoother upgrades and operations as well as fixes for ENI mode targetting the CAPA migration.
