title: Workload Cluster Release v12.1.0 for KVM
---

This release includes two **significant improvements to NGINX Ingress Controller**. It also includes a **fix for Quay being a single point of failure** by using Docker mirroring feature. This ensures availability of all images needed for node bootstrap, thus the cluster creation/scaling doesnâ€™t depend on Quay availability anymore.

**The two NGINX Ingress Controller improvements:**

- Multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers per tenant cluster are now supported, enabling separation of internal vs external traffic, dev vs prod, and so on.
- Management of NGINX IC NodePort Service is moved from kvm-operator to NGINX IC App itself. This enables configurability of external traffic policy and lays the foundation for making NGINX IC App optional and not pre-installed in a future KVM platform release.

Along with kvm-operator, cluster-operator and NGINX IC, release includes several upstream component upgrades.

**Note for cluster upgrades:**

Please manually delete `nginx-ingress-controller` NodePort Service in `kube-system` namespace. Upgrading the cluster then recreates the NodePort Service and moves its management from kvm-operator to NGINX IC. To minimize downtime, please delegate cluster upgrades to your SE.**

**Note for future 12.1.x releases:**

To prevent downtime, please persist this and the above note until all customers are on 12.1.0 and above.
