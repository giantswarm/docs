- We introduced a new platform support table that appears in a number of docs articles dealing with a specific feature. The table indicates which platofrm provides the feature, which workload cluster release made it available (in alpha, beta or GA) or whether it is on the roadmap. ([#744](https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/pull/744))
