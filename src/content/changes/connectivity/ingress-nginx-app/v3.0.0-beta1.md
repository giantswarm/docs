title: ingress-nginx-app release v3.0.0-beta1
---

This is the first public beta release of our new `ingress-nginx` chart.

Even though we put a lot of effort into testing every change, we do not recommend you that you install this release in a production environment.

If you are currently using `v2.x.x`, this release includes breaking changes from [`v3.0.0-alpha1`](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha1). We set up a [migration guide](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/v3.0.0-beta1/migration.md) to make the upgrade as smooth as possible.

All feedback regarding this release, its changes, or our [migration guide](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/v3.0.0-beta1/migration.md) is very welcome!

The stable release `v3.0.0` will be cut as soon as all possible bugs have been fixed and improvements have been implemented.

Please also take care of the changelog of [`v3.0.0-alpha1`](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha1) as those changes are not explicitly included here.
