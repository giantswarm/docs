### Added
- Support for annotations, labels and suffix on the internal controller service.\
  **NOTE:** Adding, changing or removing the `suffix` results in a different name of the controller service resource. Since Helm does not keep track of the old resource, we recommend to uninstall and reinstall the app when changing the suffix.
### Changed
- Aligned internal controller service and its configuration parameters to the normal one.
- Omit `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol` for `use-proxy-protocol: "false"`.
