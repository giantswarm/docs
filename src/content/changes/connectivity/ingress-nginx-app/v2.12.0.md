### Changed
- Reduced default resource requests to former profile `small` (at least 500m of CPU and 600Mi of memory) and let HPA care about scaling.
### Removed
- Support for `cluster.profile` parameter. This parameter was not set on either management clusters nor workload clusters and so the default resource requests configured in `controller.resources` got used.
