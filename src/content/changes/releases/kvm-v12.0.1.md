**If you are upgrading from 12.0.0, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release updates NGINX Ingress Controller to the latest upstream release.
Most importantly, it includes a fix for a regression introduced in the previous upstream release related to `use-regex` and `rewrite` annotations.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.
