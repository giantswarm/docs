**If you are upgrading from 9.0.7, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release updates NGINX Ingress Controller to the latest upstream release.
Most importantly, it includes a fix for a regression introduced in the previous upstream release related to `use-regex` and `rewrite` annotations.

**Note to SEs when upgrading from 8.5.0 or 9.0.0:** Existing customer automation or processes that manage the configuration of coredns, nginx-ingress-controller, or cluster-autoscaler must be modified in order to work with the changed location and format of the *-user-values configmaps. Please see our docs on [Giant Swarm Release Versions: Versions that use the App Platform](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/release-versions/#versions-that-use-the-app-platform) for more details.

**Note for future 9.0.x releases:** Please include this note and the one above in all future 9.0.x releases.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.
