This release fixes a problem with the cluster role for chart-operator, which is responsible for installing and updating Managed Apps. The changes affect only Managed Apps and upgrading to this release will not cause cluster nodes to be rolled. **To prevent encountering problems when installing or updating an app, please upgrade to this release.**

**Please Note:** We are still resolving the issue with network traffic between node pools in 10.x and 11.x clusters reported yesterday (5th Feb 2020).
