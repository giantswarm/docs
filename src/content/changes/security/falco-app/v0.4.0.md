### Changed
- **Note:** Due to breaking changes in the official chart, it is not possible to cleanly replace an existing Falco DaemonSet from a previous version with this new version. As a result, when updating to this version, there will be a short Falco downtime while the existing DaemonSet is deleted and replaced.
- Update `falco` to upstream version 0.33.0 / chart version 2.2.0.
- Update `falco-exporter` to upstream version 0.8.0 / chart version 0.9.1.
- Update `falcosidekick` to upstream version 2.26.0 / chart version 0.5.9.
