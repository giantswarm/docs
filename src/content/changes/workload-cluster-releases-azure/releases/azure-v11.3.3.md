title: Workload cluster release v11.3.3 for Azure
---

**If you are upgrading from 11.3.1 or 11.3.2, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release adds support for using a different CIDR for the control plane and the tenant clusters which makes it more flexible when users need to connect the tenant cluster network with their own virtual or on-premise networks.

**Note when upgrading from v11.2.x to v11.3.x:**

This release contains the replacement of CoreOS with Flatcar introduced in v11.3.0. Please carefully read release notes for 11.3.0 including Flatcar OS migration [steps](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/azure/v11.3.0).

**Note for future v11.3.x releases:**

Please persist this and the above note until all customers are in v11.3.0 and above.
