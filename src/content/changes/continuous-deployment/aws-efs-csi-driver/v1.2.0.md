⚠️ Attention: Minor release [1.2.0] contains breaking changes in default user values! The name of the service account changed to `efs-csi-sa` for both components. This affects clusters with already configured IRSA roles. You either need to update the trust identity policy on the role to match the new service account or set service account names to the original values via the values file. ⚠️
### Updated
- Extract registry from container images to allow set it for all images on the value level.
- Change node-selector values to fit the new scheme.
- Configure the same service account for both controller and node to simplify IRSA role permissions.
