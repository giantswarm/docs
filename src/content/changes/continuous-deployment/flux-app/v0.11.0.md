### Changed
- Bump upstream flux toolkit version to v0.30.2.
  This app version upgrades Flux workloads and resource definitions from
  v0.27.3 to v0.30.2. The two upstream releases in between ([Flux v0.28.0] and
  [Flux v0.29.0]) contain potentially breaking changes, the main difference
  being graduating custom resource API versions. Please read linked upstream
  changelogs and [Flux Source v1beta2 API upgrade] document before performing
  an upgrade.
