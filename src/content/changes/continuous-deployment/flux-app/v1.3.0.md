### Added
- Added support for `.global.podSecurityStandards.enforced` Helm value (defaults to false) to control PSP creation when.
  When the flag is disabled (default) the PSS is created and the `crd-controller` ClusterRole is updated with the permission
  to use the created (`flux-app-pvc-psp`) PSP. Pre kubernetes v1.25 upgrade and on v1.25 clusters where PSPs are no longer
  available, this flag should be enabled to skip the creation of the PSP and the update to the CLusterRole.
- Added support for `.policyException.namespace` Helm value to control where Kyverno PolicyException is created, defaults to: `giantswarm`
- Added support for `.cilium.enforce` Helm value (defaults to false) to force creation of the Cilium network policy in
  cases when Helm capability checks are not available.
- Added support for `.policyException.enforce` Helm value (defaults to false) to force creation of the Cilium policy in
  cases when Helm capability checks are not available.
### Changed
- Refactored chart upgrade process from `kustomzie` + manual based to be `git` patch based and made the templates structure better for readability.
### Fixed
- Fix `notification-controller` endpoint in `kustomize-controller` deployment settings to point to the controller in the same namespace.
### Removed
- Removed `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: flux` labels from upstream resources
- Removed `app.kubernetes.io/version: ...` labels from upstream resources
- Removed `app.kubernetes.io/component: ...-controller` labels from upstream resources
