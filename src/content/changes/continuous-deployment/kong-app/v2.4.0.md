### Breaking Changes
- KIC now defaults to version 2.1. If you use a database, you must first perform a temporary intermediate upgrade to disable KIC before upgrading it to 2.x and re-enabling it. See the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/blob/master/helm/kong-app/UPGRADE.md#disable-ingress-controller-prior-to-2x-upgrade-when-using-postgresql) for detailed instructions.
- ServiceAccount are now always created by default unless explicitly disabled. ServiceAccount customization has [moved under the `deployment` section of configuration](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/blob/master/helm/kong-app/UPGRADE.md#changed-serviceaccount-configuration-location) to reflect this. This accommodates configurations that need a ServiceAccount but that do not use the ingress controller. ([#455](https://github.com/Kong/charts/pull/455))
### Updates
- Align with upstream chart [2.6.4](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/CHANGELOG.md#264)
- Default Kong IC version updated to 2.1
- Default Kong proxy version updated to 2.7
**Note** chart versions 2.3.0 through 2.5.0 contained an incorrect KongIngress CRD. The proxy.path field was missing. Helm will not fix this automatically on upgrade. You can fix it by running:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/charts/main/charts/kong/crds/custom-resource-definitions.yaml
```
