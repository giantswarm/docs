If you are upgrading from chart version lower than 3.0.0, it is neccessary to perform an intermediate upgrade to chart version 3.0.0 as this version contains a required migration process for enabling the use of seccompProfiles.
### Changes
- Align with upstream chart version [2.16.4](https://github.com/Kong/charts/releases/tag/kong-2.16.4) ([Changes in upstream repository](https://github.com/Kong/charts/compare/kong-2.16.2...kong-2.16.4))
  - Fix template issue preventing custom dblessconfig volume from being mounted.

    [#744](https://github.com/Kong/charts/pull/744)
