### Changed
- Upgraded chart dependency to [kube-prometheus-stack-55.4.0](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/releases/tag/kube-prometheus-stack-55.4.0)
    - This PR configures the value of GOGC to 30 (instead of 100) for Prometheus-Operator deployment to reduce it's resource usage.
