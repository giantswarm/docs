### Changed
- Upgraded chart dependency to [kube-prometheus-stack-56.6.2](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/releases/tag/kube-prometheus-stack-56.6.2)
  - prometheus-operator upgraded from v0.70.0 to v0.71.2
  - kube-state-metrics upgraded from 5.15 to 5.16
  - prometheus-node-exporter upgraded from 4.24 to 4.26
  - grafana upgraded from 7.0 to 7.3
  - prometheus-windows-exporter upgraded from 0.1 to 0.3
  - thanos upgraded from 0.33.0 to 0.34.0
### Breaking
- Prometheus resources now support `scale` subresource (https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pull/5962). This can break existing VPAs, which should now target the `prometheus` resource instead of the `statefulset`.
