Changelog for 2.7.3:
* PR [#182](https://github.com/inlets/inlets/pull/182) Enable strict filtering feature for client by @alexellis
* PR [#181](https://github.com/inlets/inlets/pull/181) add option to select address to bind to by @jsiebens

### Client: Strict forwarding policy

By default, the server code can access any host. The client specifies a number of upstream hosts via `--upstream`. If you want these to be the only hosts that the server can connect to, then enable strict forwarding.

* `--strict-forwarding`

This is off by default, however when set to true, only hosts in `--upstream` can be accessed by the server. It could prevent a bad actor from accessing other hosts on your network.

### Server: Bind to a different adapter, or to localhost

By default the inlets server will bind to all adapters and addresses on your machine.

At times, you may wish to change this, so that you can "hide" the HTTP websocket behind a reverse proxy, adding TLS termination and link-level encryption without exposing the plain HTTP port to the network or Internet.

Usage:

* `--bind-addr 127.0.0.1`
* `--bind-addr 10.0.101.20`
