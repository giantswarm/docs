### New features

- The `gsctl create cluster` command now offers the `--aws-instance-type` option. On AWS installations, this allows you to set the EC2 instance type for (all) worker nodes of a new cluster. The official instance type identifier, e. g. `m3.large`, is expected as value. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/138)

Note that not all instance types may be allowed on your installation. Pleas contact the Giant Swarm support team to help you find out which are the allowed types on your installation.

### Minor changes

- The timeout for the API operations backing `gsctl list clusters` has been increased to reduce the likelyhood of an error (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/136)
