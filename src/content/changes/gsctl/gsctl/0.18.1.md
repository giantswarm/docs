### New features

- The `gsctl show cluster` command now also prints the URL of this cluster's details in our web UI. In terminals like iTerm (Mac) this allows you to open the web UI page with one Cmd-Click. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/481

### Bugfixes

- Fixed some incorrect usage info in the `gsctl update cluster` command. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/482
