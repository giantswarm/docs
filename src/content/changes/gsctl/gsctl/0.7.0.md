### New features

- The `gsctl scale cluster` command has been added to change the number of worker nodes in a cluster. See the [reference page](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/scale-cluster/) for details. ([#106](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/106))

### Changes and Bugfixes

- We fixed a problem that prevented the Linux binary to be executed in a Docker container. As part of the fix, the Linux binary is no longer compiled statically. Instead it is linked against glibc. This means it can be run inside recent Ubuntu/Debian containers without modification. Using it inside an Alpine based image requires the addition of glibc. See [this comment](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/111#issuecomment-318683873) for an example. ([#111](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/111))

- The `gsctl version` command now checks whether a newer version exists. The output has also changed to always show the build date. ([#108](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/108))

- The output of the `gsctl list clusters` command has been fixed to always and in a line break. ([#103](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/103))
