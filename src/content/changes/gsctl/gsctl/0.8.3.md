### Minor changes

- The output of `gsctl list keypairs` now also includes the columns CN (Common Name) and O (Organizations), which are relevant to role based access control (RBAC) (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/132)

### Bugfixes

- Issue [#126](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/126) was closed. When calling the `gsctl info` command with an arbitrary endpoint defined via the `-e|--endpoint` flag, it was falsely printed that the user was logged in. ([#133](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/133))
