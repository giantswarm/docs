### Changes

The `create keypair` and `create kubeconfig` commands now support two additional optional flags:

`cn_prefix` and `certificate_organizations` for influencing the Subject of the issued certificate in order to control the rights of your issued certificates using Kubernetes RBAC Authorization.

See the reference pages for [`create keypair`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/create-keypair/) and [`create kubeconfig`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/create-kubeconfig/) for more info.
