### New features

- `gsctl create kubeconfig` supports creation of a self-contained kubectl config file with inline credentials, to simplify handing these out to third parties. Add the `--self-contained <output-path>` flag. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/162)
- `gsctl create kubeconfig` also allows to set a custom context name using the `--context` flag, for easier memorizing. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/164)

### Minor changes

- The expiry of a new key pair created with `gsctl create kubeconfig` or `gsctl crete keypair` is now printed in a way that's easier to read than just a number of hours. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/167)

### Bugfixes

- The permissions for the config file are now set so that only the owner has access. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/165)
