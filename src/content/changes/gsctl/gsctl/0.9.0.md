### New features

- The new command `gsctl show cluster` allows to display cluster details. See the [reference](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/show-cluster/) for details. (#144)
- With the new command `gsctl completion` it is now possible to generate basic shell completion files for bash and zsh. See `gsctl completion --help` for details. (#150)
- A new command `gsctl list releases` has been added to list all available releases on the installation. This will provide useful once cluster upgrading is supported. (#140)

### Minor changes

- The output of `gsctl list endpoints` is now sorted by endpoint URI and the selected endpoint is highlighted, if coloured terminal output is active. (#141)
- When creating a cluster using `gsctl create cluster`, using the flag `--kubernetes-version`, which never had any effect, will now yield a deprecation error. (#154)
