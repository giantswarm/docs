### New features

#### Endpoint aliases

API endpoint URLs (also called endpoints) now automatically get an alias to simplify the selection of an endpoint. The alias is a unique codename for every Giant Swarm installation.

The alias can be used to reference an endpoint instead of having to use the entire URL. Examples:

```
gsctl select endpoint <alias-or-url>
gsctl <some-command> --endpoint <alias-or-url>
gsctl <some-command> -e <alias-or-url>
```

The alias will be set on a first login with a new endpoint. To add an alias to endpoints already existing in your configuration, you have to manually add the `alias` key to the endpoint entry. Your default configuration file is in `$HOME/.config/gsctl/config.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
endpoints:
  https://api.g8s.europe.example.com:
    alias: europe
    email: developer@example.com
    token: mytoken
  https://api.g8s.asia.example.com:
    alias: asia
    email: developer@example.com
    token: othertoken
```

**Caution:** When manually editing an endpoint alias, make sure that it is unique in your configuration file and that the result is valid YAML.

The `gsctl info` command shows the alias of the currently selected endpoint, if applicable.

(#180, #184)

### Minor changes

- Certificates and private keys for expired key pairs are now automatically removed from the `certs` directory (#171).
- Added an alias to the `gsctl select endpoint` command. `gsctl select endpoints` will also work (#178).
- The output of `gsctl list releases` is now sorted by the version number, in semver fashion (#186).

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a possible nil pointer exception in `gsctl logout` (#176).
