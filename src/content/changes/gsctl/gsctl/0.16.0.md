### New features

- `gsctl create cluster` now supports passing cluster definition YAML via standard input. This can save you the step to create a YAML file first. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/421

### Minor changes

- gsctl now provides more user-friendly feedback in the case of TLS problems. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/419
- `gsctl info` and `gsctl version` now show more build details, including Github links and the commit hash. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/408 https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/422
- gsctl binaries are now built using Go 1.12.9. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/423


### Bugfixes

- We fixed the problem that `gsctl info` and `gsctl version` would no longer output the version information. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/408
- We fixed the usage info for `gsctl completion` for bash. The correct command for reading the completion from STDIN is `source <(gsctl completion bash --stdout)`. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/409
