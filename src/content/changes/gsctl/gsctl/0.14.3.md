### Minor changes

The `gsctl show cluster` command now also shows a list of availability zones the cluster is running in. The availability zones get selected randomly. 

*Note: On AWS the names of availability zones are randomized per account. So `eu-west-1a` in the clusters account can be any other availability zone in a different account*
