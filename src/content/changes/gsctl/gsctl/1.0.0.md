title: gsctl release v1.0.0

A new major release? Well, for no special reason. We wanted to get rid of the leading zero for quite some time.

### New features

- The `gsctl create kubeconfig` command now offers the `--kubie` flag. When [kubie](https://github.com/sbstp/kubie) is installed and the flag is used, a new shell is launched with the cluster and new key pair as selected kubectl context, without modifying the `current-context` in the kubectl config.

### Changes

- Use more specific terminology for `release` in help texts: `workload cluster release`.
- Update documentation URLs.
