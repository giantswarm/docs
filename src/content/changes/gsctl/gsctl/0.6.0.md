### Changes

- Configuration and obtained certificates are now stored in the `$HOME/.config/gsctl` directory (formerly `$HOME/.gsctl`), to reduce cluttering of a user's home directory. If you used a prior version of `gsctl`,
 your configuration and certificates are automatically moved to the new location.(https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/issues/39)
- We fixed a problem in `gsctl create kubeconfig` where the suggested command to switch to a context was wrong. Of course, the right command to use has to be `kubectl config use-context <your-context>`. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/issues/61)
