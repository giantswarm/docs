### New features

#### Endpoint management ([#47](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/47), [#120](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/120))

- The new concept of the "selected endpoint" eliminates the need to set an API endpoint with every command. You can now be logged in with several API endpoints at the same time. Endpoints can be switched easily.
- Use `gsctl select endpoint <endpoint>` to switch to a specific endpoint.
- Use `gsctl list endpoint` to show endpoints used and your login status.
- Use `gsctl login <email> -e <endpoint>` to add an endpoint and select it.
- Use `gsctl logout` to log out from the current endpoint.

See the according [reference pages](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/) and [Easily switching between environments](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/global-options/#switching-environments) for details.

### Minor changes

- Binaries are now built using Go 1.9 ([#123](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/123))
- `gsctl list clusters` output is now sorted by ID. The organization column has been moved to second position. ([#125](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/125))
- Windows binaries are now signed ([#119](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/119))
- `create keypair` and `create kubeconfig`: The `--cn_prefix` and `--certificate_organizations` flags have been renamed to `--cn-prefix` and `--certificate-organizations` ([#118](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/118))

### Bugfixes

- Fixed some cases where a token given via `--auth-token` has not been applied. ([#92](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/92))
