### New features

- The new command `gsctl upgrade cluster` allows to upgrade a cluster to the next release version. Please read the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/cluster-upgrades/) before use. ([#192](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/192))

### Minor changes

- Binaries are now built using Go v1.11.1.
- We introduced validation of the `--cn-prefix` flag in the `create kubeconfig` and `create keypair` commands to help users using the allowed character set only. ([#306](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/306), [#307](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/307))
