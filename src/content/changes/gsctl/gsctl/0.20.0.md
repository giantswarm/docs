### New features

- The `create nodepool` command now supports requesting spot instances. See our [reference docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/create-nodepool/) for details. The `list nodepools` and `show nodepool` commands have also been updated to display information related to spot instances. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/528
- The new environment variable `GSCTL_AUTH_TOKEN` can be used to specify an auth token to use, as an alternative to the global `--auth-token` flag especially in an automation context. The flag will take precedence when set. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/issues/121 https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/530

### Minor changes

- When creating a key pair with lifetime larger than 30 days with the `create kubeconfig` or `create keypair` commands, you will be prompted for confirmation. This prompt can be deactivated using the `--force` flag.
- The `list clusters` command has been updated to respect the `--show-deleting` flag also when `-o json` is used.
- The `create kubeconfig` and `create keypair` commands give a descriptive error message if you try to create a key pair for a cluster that is too young to have a working PKI backend. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/532
