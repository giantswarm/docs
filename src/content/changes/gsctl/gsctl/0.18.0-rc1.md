---

This is a pre-release for 0.18.0 which introduces **Node pools** functionality to `gsctl`. For more information on node pools, see https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/

## New features

- The `gsctl create cluster` command supports clusters with node pools. **Note:** Many flags which allowed to specify worker node details in the past have been removed. To specify worker node details, please use the [cluster definition](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/cluster-definition/) format from now on.
- `gsctl list nodepools` allows listing node pools of a cluster.
- `gsctl create nodepool` allows creating a node pool.
- `gsctl update nodepool` allows scaling and renaming of a node pool.
- `gsctl delete nodepool` does what the name indicates.
