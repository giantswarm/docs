### New features

- The commands `gsctl list clusters` and `gsctl list keypairs` now allow to print output as JSON, to simplify the use in automation and scripting. Use the `--output json` (short: `-o json`) flag to enable JSON output. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/431 https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/432 

### Minor changes

- The timeout for most API calls has been set to 10 seconds. Before it was 60 seconds. This should reduce your wait time until you find out something is wrong with your connection. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/445

### Bugfixes

- If no releases can be found, `gsctl list releases` no longer prints table headers for an empty table. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/446
