### New features

- We introduce a new `--sort`/`-s` flag to the `gsctl list clusters` command to allow you to influence the output ordering. Sorting your tons of clusters by release, owner organization or creation date? Here you go.

### Minor changes

- To get the version of `gsctl`, please use `gsctl --version` from now on. The old command `gsctl version` will show you a deprecation warning and will be removed at some point in the future.
