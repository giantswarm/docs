title: gsctl Release v0.18.0
---

This is the first gsctl release fully supporting node pool clusters.

## Improvements

Most improvements have been included in the 0.18.x pre-releases ([here](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/releases/tag/0.18.0-rc1) and [there](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/releases/tag/0.18.0-rc3)). Please check the release notes for details.

Additionally, this release brings:

- `gsctl create nodepool`: fix handling of minimum and maximum worker node count if only one of the two are given. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/479
- Handling of a *Malformed response* error, which is normally a permission problem due to bad network membership (e. g. missing VPN connection), has been improved in all commands. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/478
- `gsctl show clusters`: For a node pools cluster, we added some guidance to the output to help you discover node pools details etc. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/480
