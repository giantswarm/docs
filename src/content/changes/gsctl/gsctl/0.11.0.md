### Minor changes

- Key pair lifetime can be shorter than a day. The `create kubeconfig` and `create keypair` command's optional flag `--ttl` now **requires** a number and a unit, e. g.  `3h` for 3 hours. Units accepted are `h`, `d`, `w`, `m`, `y`. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/issues/137, https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/228) - **BREAKING**

- After creating a cluster through the `create cluster` command, users are now informed in more detail how to create credentials to access the clusters, with special attention to Role based access control (RBAC) (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/219)

- When creating a cluster using `create cluster`,  setting a non-existing organization as owner will produce a more meaningful error message. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/227)
