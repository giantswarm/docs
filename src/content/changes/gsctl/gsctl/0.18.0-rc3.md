## New features

- The `gsctl upgrade cluster` command now supports v5 clusters. In case you wonder, those are the ones supporting [node pools](https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/). https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/470

## Improvements

- When deleting a cluster using the `gsctl delete cluster` command, you will be prompted to enter the ID of the cluster to be deleted. The goal here is to help you re-consider which cluster you are about to destroy forever. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/463
- The `gsctl list clusters` command can now show when there are cluster in deletion. However this only applies to v5 clusters, not v4, and will thus only affect AWS at first. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/468 https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/471
- The `gsctl list nodepools` command now shows a friendly error when the given cluster is not a node pools (v5) cluster. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/466
- The `gsctl create cluster` command now gives more specific error details when a cluster definition read from STDIN cannot be parsed. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/465
- The handling of an API error with status code 500 (internal server error) has been aligned and made more user-friendly in all commands. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/461
- The error handling for `gsctl delete nodepool` has been improved. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/467

## Bugfixes

- A problem with the `gsctl scale cluster` command has been fixed that would make the command effectively unusable. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/474
- Usage info in `gsctl create cluster` has been fixed. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/469 https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/464
