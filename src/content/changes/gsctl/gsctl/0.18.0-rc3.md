## New features

- The `gsctl upgrade cluster` command now supports v5 clusters. In case you wonder, those are the ones supporting [node pools](https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/). ([#470](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/470))

## Improvements

- When deleting a cluster using the `gsctl delete cluster` command, you will be prompted to enter the ID of the cluster to be deleted. The goal here is to help you re-consider which cluster you are about to destroy forever. ([#463](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/463))
- The `gsctl list clusters` command can now show when there are cluster in deletion. However this only applies to v5 clusters, not v4, and will thus only affect AWS at first. ([#468](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/468), [#471](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/471))
- The `gsctl list nodepools` command now shows a friendly error when the given cluster is not a node pools (v5) cluster. ([#466](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/466))
- The `gsctl create cluster` command now gives more specific error details when a cluster definition read from STDIN cannot be parsed. ([#465](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/465))
- The handling of an API error with status code 500 (internal server error) has been aligned and made more user-friendly in all commands. ([#461](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/461))
- The error handling for `gsctl delete nodepool` has been improved. ([#467](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/467))

## Bugfixes

- A problem with the `gsctl scale cluster` command has been fixed that would make the command effectively unusable. ([#474](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/474))
- Usage info in `gsctl create cluster` has been fixed. ([#469](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/469), [#464](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/464))
