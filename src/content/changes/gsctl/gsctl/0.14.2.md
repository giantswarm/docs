### New features

The `gsctl create cluster` command now has a new flag `--availability-zones`. The flag specifies the number of availability zone a cluster should have. The default is `1` and you can only specify more than one availability zones together with a Giant Swarm provider and release version that supports [multiple availability zones](https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/multiaz/).

### Minor changes

We've increased the timeout for API calls. This was made for clusters that had lots of keypairs. In the mean time we also improved the keypair listing performance so there are no more API calls that make you wait for 20 seconds.
