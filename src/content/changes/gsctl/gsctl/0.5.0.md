### Changes

- The cluster-related functions have been updated to work with the latest API version (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/53)
- The `gsctl info` command no longer outputs the two empty linkes about "Selected organization" and "Selected cluster" (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/52)
- Some API requests now fail faster due to much shorter timeouts (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/50)
- gsctl now sends a `User-Agent` header with `gsctl/<version>` with every API call (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/50)
- Unexpected API responses are now handled in a unified way, hopefully returning all required information to track down a problem (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/32)
