### Minor changes

- The `gsctl version` command now uses a different URL to detect which is the latest `gsctl` version. The URL used by `gsctl` until 0.14.3 will only be updated one more time, to inform about this release being available.
- The single-sign-on HTML code has been improved for readability.
