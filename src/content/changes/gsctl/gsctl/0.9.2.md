### Bugfixes

- When using `gsctl create kubeconfig` with the new `--context <name>` option introduced in 0.9.1, the given context name was not shown in the command's output, although the context had been created with the given name. This is fixed now. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/174)
- When sending the command line used to execute `gsctl` along with API requests, passwords given via the command line arguments `--password` or `-p` with the `gsctl login` command are now redacted. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/170)
