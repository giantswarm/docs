### New features

- There is now a command `gsctl delete endpoint` to remove an endpoint from the configuration. Use this command if you no longer want to work with an API endpoint. [#501](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/501)

### Minor changes

- gsctl now warns you when trying to connect to an API endpoint via the HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS. [#499](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/499)

### Bugfixes

- `gsctl scale cluster` and `gsctl upgrade cluster` have been fixed to work well with clusters using the v4 API (currently that's all Azure, all KVM, and AWS >= 10.0.0). [#495](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/495) [#497](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/497)
- The `gsctl delete nodepool` command panicked when the argument did not have the expected syntax. This is fixed now and presents a helpful message about the syntax to use. [#503](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/503)
