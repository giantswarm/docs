title: gsctl release v0.2.0
---

- New command `gsctl version` added, to get nothing but the current version number (and build date, when used with `--verbose`)
- With most API requests, three additional headers are sent, for the purpose of analysing `gsctl` usage:
  - `X-Request-ID` is a randomly generated ID for the a request or a group of related requests, which also simplifies debugging in the case of an error.
  - `X-Giant-Swarm-Activity` is an activity name like `list-clusters`, which gives us a better idea for which user activities an API request has been made.
  - `X-Giant-Swarm-CmdLine`: Contains the command line used to invoke gsctl. Sending this header can be suppressed by setting the `GSCTL_DISABLE_CMDLINE_TRACKING` environment variable.
- Colors can now be turned off by setting the environment variable `GSCTL_DISABLE_COLORS`.
- Table output for the command `gsctl list`has been changed so that only headers are printed in color, while data rows use the default terminal color.
- To make table column headers easier to distinguish from data rows, even with colors disabled, they are now CAPITALIZED.
