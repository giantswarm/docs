### New features

- This `gsctl` release adds support for [high availability Kubernetes masters](https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/ha-masters/) which is available on AWS starting with release v11.4.0 ([#554](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/554), [#561](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/561)). The changes in detail are:
  - `gsctl create cluster` now supports specifying multiple/single master nodes. Note: on AWS from v11.4.0, clusters will have multiple master nodes by default.
  - `gsctl update cluster` allows converting a single master cluster on AWS with release v11.4.0 and higher to a multi master cluster. Check the details for the `--master-ha` flag in the [reference](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/update-cluster/).
  - The `gsctl show cluster` command shows details on master nodes, including the number of nodes in `Ready` state and their availability zones.
- We added support for the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) to the `gsctl completion` command. Add `--help` for instructions. ([#558](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/558), [#559](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/559))

### Fixes

- Panic in `gsctl list nodepools` due to slice bounds out of range ([#563](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/563))
