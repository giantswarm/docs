### Changes

- We added support for API certificates signed by authorities that are not known to the operating system. CAs installed via the user's Mac OS keychain are now accepted. In addition, the environment variable `GSCTL_CAFILE` can be used to point `gsctl` to a CA bundle in PEM format. Alternatively, `GSCTL_CAPATH` can point to a directory containing CA certificates/bundles in PEM format. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/issues/96)
