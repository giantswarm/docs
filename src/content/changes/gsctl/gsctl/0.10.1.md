### New features

- When on Microsoft Azure, cluster details reported by `gsctl show cluster` will contain the Virtual Machine size.
- When on a KVM-based installation, the `gsctl show cluster` command will show details about Ingress port mappings. See the [reference](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/show-cluster/) for details.

### Minor changes

- Some failures to connect to the API endpoint, especially 403 (Forbidden) errors, are now handled in a more user-friendly way and display information on the possible cause of the problem.
- Builds and tests now use go version 1.10
