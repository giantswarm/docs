### Minor changes

- The `gsctl show cluster` command now shows provider credentials for AWS or Azure in case the cluster is running in a different account/subscription than the default one. That is the case when provider credentials have been set for the organization using [`update organization set-credentials`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/update-org-set-credentials/). (#308)

### Bugfixes

- The `gsctl upgrade cluster` command would select the next version, from the perspective of the cluster's current version, as the target to upgrade to, without checking whether that version is active or deprecated. This prevented an upgrade on the API side. Now the next active release is selected. (#310)
