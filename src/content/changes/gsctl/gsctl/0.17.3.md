### New features

- The `gsctl list releases` command now allows to print output as JSON, to simplify the use in automation and scripting. Use the `--output json` (short: `-o json`) flag to enable JSON output. [#451](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/451)
- The `gsctl info` command now prints environment variables relevant to `gsctl`. [#450](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/450)

### Bugfixes

- Enabled the use of `gsctl show cluster` again on Azure and KVM installations. [#454](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/454)
- Fixed a bug that would pretty much make the output of `gsctl list releases` unusable. [#453](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/453)
