### Minor changes

- Deprecated flags have been removed from `gsctl scale cluster`: `--memory-gb`, `--num-cpus`, 
`--storage-gb`. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/442
- The `gsctl create kubeconfig` command, when used with the `--self-contained` flag, would log two lines of information which were not useful. This has been disabled as part of https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/437.

### Bugfixes

- A problem in `gsctl scale cluster` has been fixed that caused a panic with error `Provider must not be empty: invalid config error`. https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/442
