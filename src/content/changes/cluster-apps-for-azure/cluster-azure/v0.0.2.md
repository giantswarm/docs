### Added
- Initial support to create a workload cluster via CAPI/CAPZ.
- Add support for creating cluster with `UserAssigned Identity` for `VM Identity`
- Add `cluster.x-k8s.io/watch-filter: capi` to common labels.
### Changed
- replace version with `0.0.0-dev` in Chart.yaml since we use App Build Suite
- Allow customizing the `identityRef` in the `AzureCluster`
- Fix MachinePool naming by removing the hashed name from all resources. This is not needed for MachinePools , like it is for MachineDeployments
- Skip `coredns` installation phase in `kubeadmbootstrapconfiguration` , we install it as an App
- Do not consider the `labels` in the ControlPlane AzureMachineTemplate when calculating name hash to avoid rolling control plane nodes unecessarily
- Change default values ssh key to RSA one ( since azure does not support ed25519 )
- Update schema json
