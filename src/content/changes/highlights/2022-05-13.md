## User interfaces

Our web UI, as of [v1.42.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/releases/tag/v1.42.0), provides a great new feature to all customers with single sign-on (SSO). As a user you can now inspect which permissions you have in the Management API, with regard to certain use cases and individually for each organization.

The kubectl-gs commands for creating cluster and node pool resources (`kubect gs template cluster` and `kubect gs template nodepool`) now produce `v1beta1` resources (previously `v1alpha2` on AWS and `v1alpha3` on Azure).

## Documentation

In case you wonder how to access the Management API from your pipeline, this is for you: we now have a dedicated page on how to [authenticate with the Management API for programmatic access](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/authentication/automation/). The article provides step by step instructions and a shell script explaining how to create a kubectl config file that includes service account credentials.
