## Managed Apps

- [KEDA](https://github.com/giantswarm/keda-app) (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) is now available as an app in the Playground Catalog. Some customers report significant resource optimizations and cost savings from using KEDA.

- [Fluent log shipping v0.5.5](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/playground-apps/fluent-logshipping-app/v0.5.5/) was fixed to run using AWS Cloudwatch and S3. We also added the ability to use KIAM for Cloudwatch and updated the fluentd image.

## Web interface

- The Apps section has been re-designed completely to provide faster access to all apps, independent of the catalog they belong to.

## Documentation

- We added documentation for [spot VMs on Azure](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/spot-instances/azure/) and [Management Clusters](https://docs.giantswarm.io/general/management-clusters/).

- Our Management API CRD docs now includes annotations. See [AWSMachineDeployment](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/crd/awsmachinedeployments.infrastructure.giantswarm.io/#annotation-details-v1alpha2) for an example.
