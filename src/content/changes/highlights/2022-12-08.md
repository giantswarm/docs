## User interfaces

The web UI as of v1.54.0 allows installing of an app bundle, like the Security Pack, into workload clusters.

## Apps

In your configuration for Dex (dex-app) in workload clusters, you may notice a new connector named `giantswarm-ad`. We are adding this one to enable Giant Swarm staff access, authorized via OIDC, using Azure AD as an identity provider. We are currently rolling that out to all installations.
