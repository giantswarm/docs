## Apps

- In your configuration for Dex (dex-app) on the management cluster you may notice a new connector we are adding for Giant Swarm staff, called `giantswarm-ad`, using Azure AD as an identity provider. We are currently rolling that out to all installations. Then our GitHub connector (currently named `giantswarm`) will only be used as a fall-back.
