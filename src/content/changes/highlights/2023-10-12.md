## General

## Apps

- [security-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle) versions [1.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#110---2023-10-10) and [0.18.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/legacy/CHANGELOG.md#0180---2023-10-05) include two new tools supporting migration away from Pod Security Policies: [`exception-recommender`](https://github.com/giantswarm/exception-recommender) analyzes the current policy reports in a cluster and generates Giant Swarm `PolicyExceptionDrafts`. Once the drafts have been reviewed and accepted, [`kyverno-policy-operator`](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-policy-operator/) takes the resulting Giant Swarm `PolicyExceptions` and generates the necessary Kyverno resources to allow workloads to continue running.

## Documentation

Migration away from Pod Security Policies has begun! Please review the new [cluster administrator migration guide](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/security-policy-enforcement/cluster-admin-guide/) to learn about the new [Policy API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/security-policy-enforcement/policy-api/) and the assistive tooling available to help you securely migrate workloads off of PSPs.
