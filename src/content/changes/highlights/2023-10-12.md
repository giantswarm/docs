## Apps

- [security-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle) versions [1.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#110---2023-10-10) and [0.18.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/legacy/CHANGELOG.md#0180---2023-10-05) With these two releases we include two new tools supporting migration away from Pod Security Policies, [`exception-recommender`](https://github.com/giantswarm/exception-recommender) and [`kyverno-policy-operator`](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-policy-operator/). With [`exception-recommender`](https://github.com/giantswarm/exception-recommender) analyzes the current policy reports in a cluster get analyzed and based on the results a Giant Swarm `PolicyExceptionDrafts` gets generated. Once the drafts have been reviewed and accepted, [`kyverno-policy-operator`](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-policy-operator/) takes the resulting Giant Swarm `PolicyExceptions` and generates the necessary Kyverno resources to allow workloads to continue running.

## Documentation

We have started the migration away from Pod Security Policies! Therefore we have added a [cluster administrator migration guide](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/security-policy-enforcement/cluster-admin-guide/) containing all information about the new [Policy API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/security-policy-enforcement/policy-api/) and all the assistive tooling available to help you securely migrate workloads off of PSPs. Reach out for anyquestions regarding the Pod Security Policies to Pod Security Stadards migration
