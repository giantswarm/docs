## Apps

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` has been improved in several ways. Most important:

- When creating a client certificate for a workload cluster using `kubectl gs login`, the flag `--organization` is now effectively optional.

- You'll be notified automatically when using an outdated plugin version. Also the new `kubectl gs selfupdate` command allows to update the plugin to the latest version, for those not using Krew.

## Monitoring

You now have a new Grafana dashboard available named FluxCD.
