## Apps

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` has been improved in several ways. Most important:

- When creating a client certificate for a workload cluster using `kubectl gs login`, the flag `--organization` is now effectively optional.

- You'll be notified automatically when using an outdated plugin version. Also the new `kubectl gs selfupdate` command allows to update the plugin to the latest version, for those not using Krew.

In the web UI, we now display if a cluster has upgrades scheduled.

## Management API

For `kubectl get apps.application.giantswarm.io` (or just `kubectl get apps`) we changed the output columns for the App CRD. With that, you can now differentiate the installed version from the desired version.

Note: In automation, please make sure to use JSON or YAML output of `kubectl get` commands instead if plain text, so your implementation is not affected by a change like the above.

## Monitoring

If you are using Flux CD in the management cluster for your own good, you'll want to check out the two new Grafana dashboards on Flux CD metrics which we added this week.
