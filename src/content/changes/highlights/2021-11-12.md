## Apps

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` has been improved in several ways. Most important:

- When creating a client certificate for a workload cluster using `kubectl gs login`, the flag `--organization` is now effectively optional.

- You'll be notified automatically when using an outdated plugin version. Also the new `kubectl gs selfupdate` command allows to update the plugin to the latest version, for those not using Krew.

## Monitoring

If you are using Flux CD in the management cluster for your own good, you'll want to check out the two new Grafana dashboards on Flux CD metrics which we added this week.
