## Managed Apps

- [External Secrets Operator](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/external-secrets-operator/) We now offer External Secrets Operator both on management clusters, and as a managed app for you to deploy to your workload clusters. This supports the security of your secrets by allowing them to be injected from an external secrets store. For details about this, please see the documentation at [https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/external-secrets-operator/](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/external-secrets-operator/).

## Documentation

- [GitOps tooling](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/tools/) To support you in your GitOps driven delivery, we have added a new page to our documentation that lists some of the more common tools available to help validate manifests before deployment and track resources inside the cluster. This includes an update to our fake flux script to make it more versatile in testing manifests either locally or as part of a pre-deployment pipeline. You can find details on this in our documentation at [https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/tools/](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/tools/).
