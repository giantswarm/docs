## Managed apps

[Loki v0.1.2-beta](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/loki-app/v0.1.2-beta/) adds the option to install loki-multi-tenant-proxy to ease multi-tenant authentication and authorization. Prior, [Loki v0.1.1-alpha2](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/loki-app/v0.1.1-alpha2/) upgrades to Loki v2.2.0.

[Grafana v0.2.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/grafana-app/v0.2.0/) upgrades to upstream Grafana image v7.4.3.

[Fluent Logshipping v0.6.4](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/playground-apps/fluent-logshipping-app/v0.6.4/) breaks up the stream names for Cloudwatch Output, to help prevent from hitting API limits.

## Apps supported with best effort

[Goldilocks v0.1.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/goldilocks-app/v0.1.0/) is now available. Some customers report significant cost savings from automatically setting requests and limits for clusters.

[Cloudflared v0.0.5](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/cloudflared-app/v0.0.5/) is now available. This app allows you to launch Cloudflare Argo Tunnels and then route to services inside your cluster. Best for customers whose ingress options are constained and / or clusters run on-premises.

[Strimzi Kafka Operator v0.2.2](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/playground-apps/strimzi-kafka-operator-app/v0.2.2/) fixes and removes the duplicated registry in image entry after templating.

## Documentation

- For consistent terminology and to avoid confusion, we now use the term `Giant Swarm REST API` where we simply talked about the API or the Giant Swarm API in the past.
