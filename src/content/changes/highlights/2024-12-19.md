      * Get rid of useless `prometheus-agent` after the migration to the new `monitoring-agent` inhibitions. 


- [cluster-aws](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws) 
  - [2.5.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0) 
      * Add aws-node-termination-handler bundle
      * Values: Add `global.providerSpecific.controlPlaneAmi` & `global.providerSpecific.nodePoolAmi`.
      * Make ASG lifecycle hook heartbeat timeout configurable
      * Chart: Update `cluster` to [v1.7.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/releases/tag/v1.7.0).
      * Add `teleport-init` systemd unit to handle initial token setup before `teleport` service starts
      * Improve `teleport` service reliability by adding proper file and service dependencies and pre-start checks
      * Fix aws-nth-bundle to use the MC's kubeconfig context if it's in a different organization namespace.
Workload clusters outside the MC's `org-giantswarm` namespace failed to deploy
the bundle because `HelmRelease` does not allow specifying the MC's kubeconfig
secret namespace. The bundle was therefore switched to an `App`.
