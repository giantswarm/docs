## User interfaces

- `kubectl gs` now offers a new command `update app` to simply upgrade an installed app to a newer version.
- `kubectl gs` now also provides the capability to create client certificates for accessing workload clusters via the `login` command.

## Documentation

- We published a new guide on [how to set up Dex in a workload cluster to use OIDC authentication](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/access-management/configure-dex-in-your-cluster/).
- Our [guide on reparing AWS accounts](https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/cloud-provider-accounts/aws/) got a big update.
