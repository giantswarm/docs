## Management API

- We introduced the new custom resource `RoleBindingTemplate` to all management clusters. It allows dynamic creation and deletion of RoleBindings across organizations. Read the [docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/authorization#role-binding-templates) for more information.

## App

- [kyverno-policies-ux](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-policies-ux) version [v0.6.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-policies-ux/releases/tag/v0.6.0) introduces a new mechanism that prevents the accidental deletion of resources with the `giantswarm.io/prevent-deletion` label. Read the [docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/deletion-prevention/) for more information.
