ux/compare/v0.12.1...v0.12.2)

- [zot](https://github.com/giantswarm/zot) 
  - [2.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/zot/compare/v2.3.7...v2.4.0) 
      * Update to upstream Helm Chart `v0.1.91` and Zot `v2.1.11`.
- [shoot-controller](https://github.com/giantswarm/shoot-controller) 
  - [0.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/shoot-
controller/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0) 
      * Add a common `HelmRepository` for the default catalog. We were using the default catalog included in the reconciled workload cluster helm chart. But when the cluster app is deleted, the `HelmRepository` is also deleted, making `flux` to suspend the `HelmRelease`, leaving leftovers.
      * Disable controller-runtime cache for `Secret` and `ConfigMap`.
- [image-distribution-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/image-distribution-operator) 
  - [0.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/image-distribution-
operator/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) 
      * Allow IDO to select an upload target from the list of available hosts.
      * Correct golangci-lint config.
- [gel-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/gel-app) 
  - [1.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/gel-app/compare/v0.1.0...v1.0.0) 
      * **BREAKING** : Renamed application from EdgeDB to Gel following upstream project rename.
      * Simplify Cilium Network Policy for cloudnative-pg postgresql pods.
      * Update to gel v7.0.
- [cluster](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster) 
  - [5.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0) 
      * Remove helm `Job` that cleans up `HelmReleases`. This was needed because we were letting Helm delete the infra cluster and control plane Custom Resources, instead of letting CAPI controllers handle the deletion. This has been fixed, so the `Job` is no longer required. 
- [cluster-api-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-api-app) 
  - [6.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-api-app/compare/v5.0.0...v6.0.0)

app/compare/v1.20.8...v1.20.9) 
      * Go: Update dependencies.
- [handbook](https://github.com/giantswarm/handbook) 
  - [0.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/handbook/compare/v0.13.110...v0.14.0)
