## Apps

- [alertmanager-to-github-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/alertmanager-to-github-app) 
  - [0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/alertmanager-to-github-
app/compare/v0.1.4...v0.2.0)

operator/compare/v0.34.5...v0.35.0) 
      * Remove unused `/var/log/journal` log collection as our clusters nodes store journal logs in memory (in `/run/log/journal`).
      * Increase alloy-events cpu requests and limits to prevent throttling happening with trace ingestion.
- [loki-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app) 
  - [0.33.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/compare/v0.33.1...v0.33.2)

  - [4.80.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-
rules/compare/v4.79.1...v4.80.0) 
      * Fix alertmanager alerts to make them work with Mimir metric.
      * Tenet - Removal of noisy notify alerts that don't require immediate action
      * Remove `WorkloadClusterAPIServerAdmissionWebhookErrors` \- Too noisy, webhook errors are often transient and don't require immediate intervention
      * Remove `KubeletPLEGLatencyTooHigh` \- High PLEG latency is common and doesn't typically indicate actionable issues
      * Remove `KubeletDockerOperationsErrorsTooHigh` \- Docker operation errors are often transient and don't require immediate action
      * Remove `KubeletConditionBad` \- Kubelet condition alerts are too noisy and rarely actionable
      * Remove `CadvisorDown` \- Cadvisor downtime is often temporary and doesn't require immediate response
  - [4.79.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-
rules/compare/v4.79.0...v4.79.1) 
      * Fix `KubeStateMetricsNotRetrievingMetrics` by ignoring SLO recording rules 


  - [4.79.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-
rules/compare/v4.78.1...v4.79.0) 
      * Add new alert `TracingAndEventAgentDown` to monitor alloy-event pods and page if any are down for 30 minutes.
      * Add new alert `OTLPExporterEnqueueFailures` and `OTLPTraceForwardingErrors` to page when the tracing pipeline is not working as expected.
      * Rename `PrometheusMissingGrafanaCloud` to `MimirToGrafanaCloudExporterMissingData`
      * Remove the `PrometheusRuleFailure` in favor of `MimirToGrafanaCloudExporterRuleEvaluationFailures` targetting only the Mimir to Grafana Cloud exporter.
      * Remove `MimirRulerEventsFailed` (based on an alloy metric that does not even exist) with `MimirRulerRulEvaluationFailures` for proper rule evaluation detection.
      * update test tools to latest versions
      * fix a few alerts to pass latest checks
      * better tests output
      * Improve `KubeStateMetricsDown` and `KubeStateMetricsNotRetrievingMetrics` alert efficiency.
      * Update runbook URL in several alerts referencing the "Deployment or StatefulSet not satisfied" runbook.
      * Fix the `MonitoringAgentDown` alert which is currently erroring on all installations because both kube-state-metrics and cluster-api-monitoring app provide the same metrics.
      * Remove `LogReceivingErrors` as we do not use the observability gateway anymore.
      * Remove `PrometheusCantCommunicateWithKubernetesAPI` as it is now unused.
      * Remove `AppOperatorNotReady` alert.
      * Remove `CordonedAppExpired` alert.

      * Change the default root disk size for Karpenter node pools. Karpenter will choose the cheapest instances, and certain instances, like `g6f.xlarge` come with some drivers that require a larger disk.
