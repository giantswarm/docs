For customers using clusters on AWS or Azure, we added more information on how to spread workloads over several availability zones for better availability/resilience. If you haven't heard of `topologySpreadConstraints` before, check our [example](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/high-availability/multi-az/#example-pod-topology-spread-constraints-and-affinity).
