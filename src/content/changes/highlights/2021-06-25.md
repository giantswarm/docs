## General

As we aim to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where possible, we started replacing the term _master node_ with _control plane node_ in our communication and user interfaces.

## Managed apps

[EFK v0.5.4](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/efk-stack-app/v0.5.4/) adds a option to clean stale lock files on NFS in an init container.

[EFK v0.5.3](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/efk-stack-app/v0.5.3/) adds support to override the Kibana image registry, increasing flexibility. For example, allowing customers to install their own plugins, set default configs, etc.

## Documentation

There is a whole new page on [authentication for the Management API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/authentication/) you might want to check out.

We also added documentation on [encrypting persistent volumes using Azure Key Vault](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/storage/azure-pvc-encryption/).
