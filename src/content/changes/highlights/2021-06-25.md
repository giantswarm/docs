## General

As we aim to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where possible, we started replacing the term _master node_ with _control plane node_ in our communication and user interfaces.

## Managed apps

[EFK v0.5.4](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/efk-stack-app/v0.5.4/) adds an option to clean stale lock files in an init container. This addresses some cases when lock files are not cleaned up automatically (when NFS is used for storage) and Elasticsearch cannot start.

[EFK v0.5.3](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/efk-stack-app/v0.5.3/) adds support to override the Kibana image registry, increasing flexibility. For example, allowing customers to install their own plugins, set default configs, etc.

## Documentation

There is a whole new page on [authentication for the Management API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/authentication/) you might want to check out.

We also added documentation on [encrypting persistent volumes using Azure Key Vault](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/storage/azure-pvc-encryption/).
