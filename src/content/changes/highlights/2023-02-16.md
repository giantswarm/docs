## Apps

- [coredns-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app) [v1.14.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app/releases/tag/v1.14.2) brings an improvement in scaling. It changes the Pod Disruption Budget from `maxUnavailable: 1` to `maxUnavailable: 25%`. Based on our learnings, we have dropped the static `replicas` value, and let the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler manage the deployment scaling. At the same time, we have configured, via Config Map, the CoreDNS health checks to 5 seconds minimising DNS resolution failures during a CoreDNS pod restart.
- [k8s-dns-node-cache-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/k8s-dns-node-cache-app) [v2.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/k8s-dns-node-cache-app/releases/tag/v2.0.0) has been released. It introduces a new major version in order to support Cilium CNI in EBPf mode. The new major version should be **only** used from AWS v19 release and so on.
- [kong-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app) [v3.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0) This release upgrades Kong to release [3.1.1](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/3.1.1/CHANGELOG.md#311) which contains breaking changes. Please consider reading the upstream [Breaking changes](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/3.1.1/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes) documentation before upgrading. Users of Kong enterprise should read the [Kong Gateway changelogs of releases 3.0.0.0 onwards](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/changelog/#3000) up to 3.1.1.3. The release aligns with the upstream chart version, updates kong/kong to [3.1.1](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/3.1.1/CHANGELOG.md#311) and updates the Kong ingress controller to [2.8.1](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/2.8.1/CHANGELOG.md#281). Also the custom resource definitions to those used by the Kong ingress controller [2.8.1] got updated. Conclusion: **Changes:** Increase default requests/limits to 1 CPU and 2G memory and removes `startupProbe` from the Kong ingress controller. [More information](https://github.com/Kong/charts/pull/527#issuecomment-1014782921). **Breaking Changes:** The `minReadySeconds` value previously found at `deployment.kong.minReadySeconds` is now configured at path `deployment.minReadySeconds`.
- [kong-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app) [v3.0.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/releases/tag/v3.0.1) **Caution:** If you are upgrading from chart version lower than 3.0.0, it is necessary to perform an intermediate upgrade to chart version 3.0.0 as this version contains a required migration process for enabling the use of `seccompProfiles`. At the same time, it changes the default Pod Disruption Budget to move from `maxUnavailable: 1` to `maxUnavailable: 25%` for better scaling. Also, it includes a fix in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler's API version which detects and prevents the template issue with the custom `dblessconfigom being mounted. 
- [nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app) [v2.24.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v2.24.0) release aligns to latest upstream version and enables the configuration of a default backend. On the other hand, it adds a fix to stop targeting default backend pods with the controller service. Lastly, the release contains a change in the Pod Disruption Budget to move from `maxUnavailable: 1` to `maxUnavailable: 25%` for better scaling.
- [linkerd-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-bundle) [v0.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-bundle/releases/tag/v0.1.0) With this release we have bundled all relevant linkerd components to one installation. This bundle contains [linkerd-multicluster-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-multicluster-app), [linkerd-multicluster-link-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-multicluster-link-app), [linkerd-viz-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-viz-app), [linkerd-control-plane-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-control-plane-app) and [linkerd2-cni-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd2-cni-app). As well as examples, templates and helpers.
