## General

## Apps

## User interfaces

In our web UI's new function to inspect permission, we now also show `kubectl` commands to gather similar information from the Management API using a CLI.

We fixed the end of life date shown for Kubernetes 1.21 to June 28 in accordance with [upstream](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/#1-21). Our apologies for falsely showing the `EOL` label previously!
