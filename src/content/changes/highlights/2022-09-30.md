## User interfaces

The `kubectl gs login` command as of [v2.23.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.23.0) provides a flag `--cn-prefix`. This allows to specify the CN of a client certificate issued for workload cluster access, so that the client using the certificate can be mapped to RBAC rules which are bound to a user.
