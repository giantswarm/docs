## User interfaces

The `kubectl gs login` command as of [v2.23.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.23.0) provides a flag `--cn-prefix`. This allows to specify the CN of a client certificate issued for workload cluster access, so that the client using the certificate can be mapped to RBAC rules which are bound to a user.

## Apps
- [dex-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/dex-app) now provides Dex [v2.34.0](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/tag/v2.34.0).
- [fluent-logshipping-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/fluent-logshipping-app) version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/fluent-logshipping-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200---2022-09-28): this update supports CRI instead of the docker Format and changes the storage path to not use a tmpfs to not overload the nodes.

## Documentation

You'll now find information about our [Cluster API architecture](https://docs.giantswarm.io/general/architecture/capi/) in our docs.
