## Management API

On AWS (as on Azure) it is now possible to scale down node pools to zero nodes.

## User interfaces

We fixed issues related to preparing for providing Management API access. These include correcting the chart name when installing an app and adding a missing import in the ingress installation step. We also upgraded the `ws` dependency to address a security vulnerability.

## Documentation

We wrote an article on [Organizations](/platform-overview/organizations/), as defined in the Management API. These replace the organizations as used with the REST API. Please read the details of this transition carefully to understand the ramifications for you and your end users.

These weekly announcements now also appear in the Changes and Releases section, as their own category named [Highlights](/changes/highlights/).
