## General

Introduced in `gitops-template` repository the [`out-of-band` delivery feature](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template/blob/main/docs/repo_structure.md#mapi-and-out-of-band) that allow resources not included in Helm charts (= not supported by App CRs) to be delivered directly to workload clusters via Flux, bypassing the App Platform components.

## Apps

- [starboard-exporter](https://github.com/giantswarm/starboard-exporter) version [v0.5.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/starboard-exporter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#050---2022-06-22) introduces support for exporting CIS benchmark reports, and makes it possible to shard metrics across multiple instances of the exporter.

## User interfaces

The web UI's new permission inspection feature now also shows whether someone has the permissions required to use the web UI. Yes, we do think that makes sense.
