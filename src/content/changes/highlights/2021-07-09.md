## Managed apps

We released [loki v0.3.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/loki-app/v0.3.0/) and [promtail v0.3.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/promtail-app/v0.3.0/) with improvements related to observability and stability of both apps

## User interfaces

The **web interface** now features a **Monitoring** link, as we already mentioned in separate announcement.

[`kubectl gs template apps`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/template-app/) now provides a new flag `--app-name` to set the name of the app instance. The command also produces much cleaner templates by default.

## Documentation

To provide for a really simple start with using our App Platform, we added a new [Getting started with App Platform](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/getting-started/) guide where you can learn how to deploy apps to your clusters in a declarative way.
