    - Disable logger development mode to avoid panicking, use zap as logger
    - Fix CircleCI release pipeline

- [prometheus-meta-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-meta-operator) version [4.79.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-meta-operator/compare/v4.78.2...v4.79.0):

- [prometheus-rules](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-rules) version [4.15.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-rules/compare/v4.15.1...v4.15.2):
    - Update `MimirHPAReachedMaxReplicas` opsrecipe link
    - Fix aggregation rule of the `slo:current_burn_rate:ratio` slo.
    - Remove aggregation of slo:period_error_budget_remaining:ratio` as this value can be easily computed and creates a lot of time series in Grafana Cloud
    - Add aggregations for slo metrics to export them to grafana cloud
    - Add `MimirHPAReachedMaxReplicas` alert, to detect when Mimir's HPAs have reached maximum capacity.
    - Added dashboards to several mimir alerts
    - Change `IRSAACMCertificateExpiringInLessThan60Days` to `IRSAACMCertificateExpiringInLessThan45Days`. The ACM certificate is renewed 60 days before expiration and the alert can fire prematurely.
