## User interfaces

In [kubectl-gs](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.22.0) we have deprecated some flags in three commands, to avoid name conflicts with global flags (which are usable in all commands). You will see a warning when using the deprecated flags. This affects the following commands:

- `kubectl gs template app`: flag `--target-namespace` replaces `--namespace`, `--cluster-name` replaces `--cluster`.
- `kubectl gs template catalog`: flag `--target-namespace` replaces `--namespace`.
- `kubectl gs gitops add app`: flag `--target-namespace` replaces `--namespace`.

Please move any scripts to the new flags, as the old flags will change their meaning with the next major release of kubectl-gs.

kubectl-gs now also provides a command `get organizations`, which is a way for all management API users to list the organizations they have access to. `kubectl get organizations` in contrast requires admin permissions.

## Documentation

We added the [Documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/observability/grafana/custom-dashboards/) on how to package custom dashboards together with apps instead of packaging them into a custom repository.
