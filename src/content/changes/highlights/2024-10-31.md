## General

- [security-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle) version [`1.9.0`](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/compare/v1.8.2...v1.9.0) introduces **breaking changes**. When upgrading to this version with `Falco` enabled, the `App` may fail to upgrade due to a breaking change in the upstream chart. To complete the upgrade seamlessly, disable and then re-enable the `Falco` App by setting `apps.falco.enabled=[false|true]` [in the security-bundle user values ConfigMap](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring).
