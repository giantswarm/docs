## Apps
- Dex 2.31.0 is available (tentative)
- If you are using dex in a workload cluster, we have provided two little improvements, so that config changes will be picked up automatically, by forcing pod replacement if there is a change and also Pod disruption is managed so that one pod should remain in place on restarts, upgrades etc.
- [aws-load-balancer-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-load-balancer-controller-app) version [v1.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-load-balancer-controller-app/releases/tag/v1.1.0) updates to AWS LoadBalancer Controller version [v2.4.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/releases/tag/v2.4.1). This release uses the new Ingress API version networking.k8s.io/v1 available in kubernetes 1.19 and later releases.
