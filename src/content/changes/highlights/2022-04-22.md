## General
This week we have provided several updates for nginx-ingress-controller-app, external-dns-app and fluent-logshipping-app. Aditionally kubectl-gs is now also available for Windows.

## Apps
- nginx-ingress-controller-app [v2.11.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2110---2022-04-22) upgrades the ingress-nginx controller container image to [v1.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/Changelog.md#120). Among other changes, this release introduces deep inspection on Ingress objects. This may increase CPU usage.
- external-dns-app [v2.10.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2100---2022-04-20) updates the container image of external-dns to [v0.11.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/releases/tag/v0.11.0)
- fluent-logshipping-app [v0.7.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/fluent-logshipping-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#071---2022-04-20) and [v0.7.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/fluent-logshipping-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#070---2022-04-19) updates fluentbit to v1.9.1 and disables fluentbit if no inputs or outputs are defined. log_stream_prefix is deprecated for cloudwatch_logs plugin and therefor moves to log_stream_name

## User interfaces

kubectl-gs is now available for Windows. If you already have `kubectl` and Krew installed, all it takes is `kubectl krew install gs`. For more information, please head to the [installation docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/installation/).

The web UI now allows to retry creating a cluster or node pool, in case the form submission fails.
