## General


## Apps


## User interfaces

kubectl-gs is now available for Windows. If you already have `kubectl` and Krew installed, all it takes is `kubectl krew install gs`. For more information, please head to the [installation docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/installation/).

The web UI now allows to retry creating a cluster or node pool, in case the form submission fails.
