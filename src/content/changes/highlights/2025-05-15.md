      * Migrate from Giant Swarm deprecated operatorkit framework to kube-builder.
      * Add CiliumNetworkPolicy support.
      * Migrate from Giant Swarm deprecated `operatorkit` framework to `kube-builder`. This change introduces a few **breaking changes** :
      * Operator configuration has been moved from a configmap to command-line arguments. **This does not affect helm chart users**
      * The operator needs new rbac capabilities to be able manage `leases` and to create `events`
      * http port has been changed from 8000 to 8080.
      * Finalizers set on silences have been changed from `operatorkit.giantswarm.io/silence-operator-silence-controller` to `monitoring.giantswarm.io/silence-protection`
      * **helm** `.registry.domain` has been renamed to `image.registry` ( **breaking change** )
      * **helm** deprecated PodSecurityPolicy has been removed ( **breaking change** with kubernetes < 1.25)
      * Use `app-build-suite` to build the operator.
      * Changed container image from alpine to a non-root distroless image.
      * Fixed the linting errors from golangci-lint v2.
      * Remove the unnecessary sync job to rely on GitOps. **Breaking change** : this means that you should now use your favorite GitOps tool (flux, ArgoCD) to deploy silences on your clusters.
      * Removed Giant Swarm legacy `microerrors` package for error handling

- [konfigure](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure) 
  - [1.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure/compare/v0.17.2...v1.0.0) 
      * Almost completely exposed previously internal functions to generate the raw configurations in order to be able to use this logic as a library, e.g. in [konfigure-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure-operator/).
