## Apps

[Dex](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/management-api/) now supports more than one customer connector.

## User interfaces

In the web UI, we fixed a problem that prevented users with legacy accounts to use the "Forgot password" form.
Also fixed a problem where false node pool information was displayed after deleting a node pool and a problem in cluster creation where provider credentials were not found for organizations that have been created using a mixed case name.

## Documentation

We added an [FAQ page on kubectl-gs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/faq/) as well as a page ot help with [migration from gsctl](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/gsctl/migrate/).
