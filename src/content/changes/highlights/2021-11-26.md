## Apps

[Dex](https://github.com/giantswarm/dex-app) now supports more than one customer connector. If you plan to admit users from different identity providers to workload clusters, please give this a try and contact us in case you have questions.

## User interfaces

In the web UI, we fixed a problem that prevented users with legacy accounts to use the "Forgot password" form.

## Documentation

We added an [FAQ page on kubectl-gs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/faq/) as well as a page to help with [migration from gsctl](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/gsctl/migrate/).
