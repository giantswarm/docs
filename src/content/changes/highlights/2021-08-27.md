## Apps

[Kong v2.3.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/kong-app/v2.3.0/) upgrades to upstream chart v2.3.0, which includes Kong v2.5.0 and Kong Ingress Controller v1.3.0. Warning: Breaking change for Kubernetes clusters older than v1.16.x. Please check "Breaking Changes" paragraph in the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/CHANGELOG.md#changelog).

[NGINX IC v2.1.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/nginx-ingress-controller-app/v2.1.0/) upgrades to controller container image v0.49.0.

## User interfaces

For single sign-on users, we removed the "Helm stable" catalog from the Apps section in the web interface. To make up for it, we drastically improved the loading performance, as all catalog data is now fetched from the Management API.

`kubectl-gs` as of v1.36.0 offers an additional flag `--callback-server` to the login command. If you had trouble with a local firewall or similar before, please consider using this new flag to specify the inbound port to use. This also makes usage in a Docker container easier. Example:

```nohighlight
docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti --rm \
  -v $HOME/.kube:/root/.kube \
  quay.io/giantswarm/kubectl-gs:1.36.0 login \
  --callback-port 8080 \
  https://g8s.your-installation-domain/
```
