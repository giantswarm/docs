## Apps

TODO

- https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/kong-app/v2.3.0/

## User interfaces

For single sign-on users, we removed the "Helm stable" catalog from the Apps section in the web interface. To make up for it, we drastically improved the loading performance, as all catalog data is now fetched from the Management API.

`kubectl-gs` as of v1.36.0 offers an additional flag `--callback-server` to the login command. If you had trouble with a local firewall or similar before, please consider using this new flag to specify the inbound port to use. This also makes usage in a Docker container easier. Example:

```nohighlights
docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti --rm \
  -v $HOME/.kube:/root/.kube \
  quay.io/giantswarm/kubectl-gs:1.36.0 login \
  --callback-port 8080 \
  https://g8s.your-installation-domain/
```
