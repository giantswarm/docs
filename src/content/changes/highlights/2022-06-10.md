## General

We are introducing a *service priority classification* for workload clusters. You will see this being rolled out in various parts of our user interfaces, in documentation and monitoring. Please check our [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/labelling-workload-clusters/#service-priority) to learn more.

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` will print the cluster's service priority when using `get clusters`. The `template cluster` command now includes the service priority cluster label by default, setting the priority to the _highest_ value.

## Apps

[nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app) version [v2.12.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2121---2022-06-09): Update controller container image to [`v1.2.1`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/Changelog.md#121) which removes the root and alias directives from the internal NGINX. ([#311](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/pull/311)).

## Documentation

There is a new documentation article explaining the [permission inspection](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/permissions/) function in our web UI.
