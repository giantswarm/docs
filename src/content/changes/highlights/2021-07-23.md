## Documentation

Our [CRD docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/crd/) now feature deprecation info. On the list, there is a DEPRECATED tag. On the details pages, there is a box with details. In cases where the CRD is directly replaced by another one, this info is given in the box.

## Dashboards

The KVM resource usage dashboard has been added to Grafana.
