## Apps

### Falco

[`Falco`](https://github.com/giantswarm/falco-app) [`0.7.0`](https://github.com/giantswarm/falco-app/releases/tag/v0.7.0) is released. Which means we now use versions newer than `0.36.0`. This update brings in the [`Falcoctl`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl) tool. From now on `Falco` Images are no longer shipped with rules inside the image, instead they will now use an init container to download the rules from an rules repository (by default, this is the one from Falco themselves) and will check every six hours whether updates have taken place.
The amount of rules `Falco` installs by default has drastically been lowered, and the previous ruleset has been devided in the categories, `Standard`, `Incubating`, and `Sandbox`. `Falco` decided on this approach after community input showed an interest in a starter/default ruleset that was less noisy. 
If the whole previous ruleset is still required, it's possible to enable this in the `Falcoctl` configuration in the helm chart. For more information about the new situation regarding rules, check Falco's new [`rules repository`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules).
