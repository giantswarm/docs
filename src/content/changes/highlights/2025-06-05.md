## General

<!-- This where BREAKING CHANGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED -->

## Apps

- [alloy-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/alloy-app) 
  - [0.11.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/alloy-app/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) 
      * Upgrade Alloy upstream chart from 1.0.3 to 1.1.0
      * This bumps the version of Alloy from 1.8.3 to 1.9.0
  - [0.10.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/alloy-app/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) 
      * Add e2e tests.
      * Upgrade Alloy upstream chart from 0.12.1 to 1.0.3
      * This bumps the version of Alloy from 1.7.1 to 1.8.3 


- [observability-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-bundle) 
  - [2.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
bundle/compare/v1.16.1...v2.0.0) 
      * Clean up old and deprecated telemetry collectors:
      * `promtail`
      * `grafana-agent`
      * `promtheus-agent`
      * Disable PodSecurityPolicies by default as PodSecurityPolicies are deprecated and removed in Kubernetes v1.25+ clusters
  - [1.16.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
bundle/compare/v1.16.0...v1.16.1) 
      * Fix catalog for alloy apps as it is now pushed to the default catalog. 


  - [1.16.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
bundle/compare/v1.15.0...v1.16.0) 
      * Upgrade `alloy-app` from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0
      * This bumps the version of `Alloy` from 1.8.3 to 1.9.0 


  - [1.15.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
bundle/compare/v1.14.1...v1.15.0) 
      * Upgrade `alloy-app` from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0
      * This bumps the version of `Alloy` from 1.7.1 to 1.8.3 


- [observability-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-operator) 
  - [0.32.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
operator/compare/v0.32.0...v0.32.1) 
      * Fix Alloy image templating when the alloy app is running the latest version.
  - [0.32.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-
operator/compare/v0.31.0...v0.32.0) 
      * Updated Alloy configuration (`pkg/monitoring/alloy/configmap.go` and `pkg/monitoring/alloy/templates/monitoring-config.yaml.template`):
        * Conditionally set `alloy.alloy.image.tag` in `monitoring-config.yaml.template`. The operator now explicitly sets the tag to `1.8.3` if the deployed `alloy-metrics` app version is older than `0.10.0`. For `alloy-metrics` app versions `0.10.0` or newer, the image tag will rely on the Alloy Helm chart's defaults or user-provided values, facilitating easier Alloy image updates via the chart.
        * Adjusted indentation for `AlloyConfig` in `monitoring-config.yaml.template` from `indent 8` to `nindent 8`.
      * Improve Mimir Datasource configuration (https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/33470)
      * Enable medium level caching (caching of `/api/v1/label/${name}/values`, `/api/v1/series`, `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/metadata` for 10 minutes)
      * Enable incremental querying (only query new data when refreshing dashboards)
      * Remove old mimir datasource on all installations.

  - [16.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kube-prometheus-stack-
app/compare/v16.0.0...v16.1.0) 
      * Disable PodSecurityPolicies by default as PodSecurityPolicies are deprecated and removed in Kubernetes v1.25+ clusters

      * Made `MimirIngesterNeedsToBeScaledUp` alert less sensitive to CPU usage.

      * Rewrite Flux alerting rules towards the `gotk_resource_info` emitted by the Kube State Metrics.
      * Drop customer-related alerting rules of Flux.
      * Rules unit tests: support for `$provider` template so we can move provider-specific tests to global tests.
      * Rules unit tests: simplify files organization by removing the `capi` folder. Also fixes a bug in cloud-director tests.
      * Rules linting: run against all configured providers.
      * Exclude more containers from Rocket's `ManagementClusterContainerIsRestartingTooFrequently` alert.
