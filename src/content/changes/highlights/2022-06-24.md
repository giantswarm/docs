## General

- We added extended [validation and linting](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template#configuring-extra-validation-and-diff-previews-on-github) for GitOps repositories.

## Apps

- Loki [v0.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/releases/tag/v0.4.0) updates to Loki Upstream Chart [v0.48.5](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/loki-distributed-0.48.5) and updates Loki to [v.2.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v2.5.0). This release has some breaking changes - please see the [Changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/blob/v0.4.0/CHANGELOG.md#changes-required-in-your-valuesyaml-file) for instructions. 
- Loki [v0.4.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/releases/tag/v0.4.1) sets loki config.auth_enabled to false by default.
- Promtail [v.0.3.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/promtail-app/releases/tag/v0.3.2) updates the upstream chart to [v6.0.0](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/promtail-6.0.0) and Promtail to [v.2.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v2.5.0). This update contains some breaking changes, please see the [Changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/promtail-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changes-required-in-your-valuesyaml-file) for instructions.
- Cert-Manager [v2.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/releases/tag/v2.14.0) We fixed the broken relative URLs in the Readme. Updates to Upstream Image [v1.7.2](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.7.2) which completely removes cert-manager API versions v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1. If you need to upgrade your resources, [this document](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/remove-deprecated-apis/#upgrading-existing-cert-manager-resources) explains the process. 
- Grafana-app [v1.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/grafana-app/releases/tag/v1.0.0) Upgrade upstream chart from version 6.24.1 to 6.31.0, and grafana from 8.4.2 to 9.0.1. This release includes a small set of breaking changes that you can check [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-9-0-0/#breaking-changes). This release also allows some existing values to be templetized (tpl function) and adds a bit more configurability options (e.g. network policies).
