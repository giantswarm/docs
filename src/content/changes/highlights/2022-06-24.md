## General

## Apps

- Loki [v0.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/releases/tag/v0.4.0) updates to Loki Upstream Chart [v0.48.5](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/loki-distributed-0.48.5) and updates Loki to [v.2.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v2.5.0). This release has some breaking changes - please see the [Changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/blob/v0.4.0/CHANGELOG.md#changes-required-in-your-valuesyaml-file) for instructions. 
- Loki [v0.4.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/loki-app/releases/tag/v0.4.1) sets loki config.auth_enabled to false by default.
- Promtail [v.0.3.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/promtail-app/releases/tag/v0.3.2) updates the upstream chart to [v6.0.0](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/promtail-6.0.0) and Promtail to [v.2.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v2.5.0). This update contains some breaking changes, please see the [Changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/promtail-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changes-required-in-your-valuesyaml-file) for instructions.
- Cert-Manager [v2.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/releases/tag/v2.14.0) We fixed the broken relative URLs in the Readme. Updates to Upstream Image [v1.7.2](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.7.2) which completely removes cert-manager API versions v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1. If you need to upgrade your resources, [this document](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/remove-deprecated-apis/#upgrading-existing-cert-manager-resources) explains the process.
