## General

## User interfaces

With `kubectl gs` release [v2.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.14.0), the service priority cluster label can be set when using the `template cluster` command with the `--service-priority` flag.

You can also set the service priority label during cluster creation via the web UI, and inspect cluster labels in their raw format from the cluster details page.
