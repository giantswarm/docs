## General

To satisfy needs that expand beyond Kubernetes, we now offer Crossplane as a managed solution. This is currently experimental and is known to cause potentially critical performance issues with the cluster it's running on. With this in mind, whilst we encourage you to experiment with it, we advise you to discuss this with your account engineer prior to installation.
