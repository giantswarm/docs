      * `cluster.os.version` named template that returns the operating system version.
      * `cluster.os.tooling.version` named template which is used to obtain the OS tooling (capi-image-builder) version.
      * Use already existing helper function to render all common labels in the `MachineHealthCheck` CR.
      * Remove unnecessary new lines before and after the labels field in the CRs.
