## User interfaces

In our Web UI we now explain how to upgrade a cluster via the Management API (spoiler: `kubectl gs update cluster`) if an upgrade is available. On Azure you'll now also find information regarding the Azure Tenant in which the workload cluster is running.

In Grafana you have a new dashboard _Kubernetes Proxy_, which you can use to drill down into the kube-proxy metrics of your workload clusters.
