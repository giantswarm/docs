## Feedback wanted

- We are currently designing the kubctl-gs CLI command for deleting workload clusters. The specification is available in a public [issue](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/1559#issuecomment-1290288319). We'd love to see you add comments, ideas, and expectations.
- Our [survey](https://forms.gle/jpGjU2DRbKohoudc7) regarding cluster creation is still open. If your organization's perspective isn't included yet, you still have some time.
