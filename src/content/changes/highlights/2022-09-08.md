## General

- All management-cluster Flux installations (`flux-system`, `flux-giantswarm`) have been upgraded to Flux [v0.33.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.33.0).

## User interfaces

- We have create the first [v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of our [gitops-template repo](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template/). It includes now all examples showing how to use our GitOps offering based on Flux to achieve functionality such as management of Organizations, Workload Clusters, Secrets encryption keys, preparing and using app and cluster templates, environment propagation. To make it easier to use, we're also announcing [a new set of commands to our `kubectl gs` plugin](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/gitops/) that will allow you to avoid a lot of copying and improving of our examples and will generate part of the GitOps configuration for you.

## Apps

- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) version [v0.15.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0150---2022-08-31) upgrades to support Flux toolkit [v0.33.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.33.0). From [v0.32.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.32.0) onward, Flux comes with support for distributing Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize overlays and Terraform code as OCI artifacts.
