## General

All management-cluster Flux installations (`flux-system`, `flux-giantswarm`) have been upgraded to Flux [v0.33.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.33.0).

## User interfaces

We have created the first [v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of our [gitops-template repo](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-template/). It includes now all examples showing how to use our GitOps offering to achieve functionality such as management of organizations, workload clusters, secrets encryption, preparing and using app and cluster templates, environments propagation. To make it easier to use, we're also introducing [a new set of commands to our `kubectl gs` plugin](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/gitops/) that will allow you to easily generate parts of the GitOps configuration instead of just copying and changing it.

## Apps

- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) version [v0.15.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0150---2022-08-31) upgrades to support Flux toolkit [v0.33.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.33.0). From [v0.32.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.32.0) onward, Flux comes with support for distributing Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize overlays and Terraform code as OCI artifacts. 
- [security-pack](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-pack) version [v0.7.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-pack/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#070---2022-09-06) introduces optional support for `trivy-operator` as the upcoming replacement for `starboard`. It also includes the latest Kyverno app release ([v0.11.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0111---2022-08-23)).
- [trivy-operator-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/trivy-operator-app) version [v0.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/trivy-operator-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#010---2022-08-26) is the first public release of `trivy-operator` containing upstream version 0.1.0. We recommend `starboard` users use this release to assess their readiness to migrate to `trivy-operator`.
