## General

## User interfaces

[kubectl gs v2.29.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.29.0) brings an important change in the `login` command. Previously, the more client certificates you would create to access workload clusters, the more the PKI backend performance would get impaired. We fixed this and recommend all users to upgrade to the latest release.

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.12.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0120---2022-11-22) updates to Kyverno version 1.8.2.
- [trivy-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/trivy-app/) version [0.7.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/trivy-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#071---2022-11-21) makes it possible to use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to manage Trivy resources (on by default).
