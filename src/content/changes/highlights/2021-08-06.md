## General

The unique, immutable cluster identifier formerly called the cluster ID is now called the cluster name, and what was called name is now called description. The goal here is consistency between our user interfaces and the Management API. Likewise for node pools.

## Apps

- prometheus-operator-app v0.10.0
- linkerd2-app v0.6.0
- linkerd2-cni-app v0.3.0 and v0.4.0
- velero-app

## User interfaces

Deleting a cluster via the web interface (happa v1.15.0) now requires additional confirmation steps, to make sure you are deleting the cluster you want to delete.

Also in the web interface we start explaining how to achieve via the Management API what you're doing in the UI. This is only available when using single sign-on (SSO).

In `kubectl gs` v1.34.0, the `template app` command provides options to specify annotations and labels to be applied to an app's target namespace. Check out the [docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/template-app/) for the new flags `--namespace-annotations` and `--namespace-labels`.
