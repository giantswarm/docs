## General

<!-- This where BREAKING CHANGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED -->

## Apps

- [prometheus-rules](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-rules) 
  - [4.53.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-
rules/compare/v4.52.0...v4.53.0) 
      * Add new alert to detect missing installation logs that relates to teleport access.
      * Fine tune the `MetricForwardingErrors` so it does not trigger on sporadic issues like duplicate samples (e.g. when a pod restarts too frequently for a small time window). This alert is now based on the upstream alert and uses a percentage of failed remote storage samples as described in this issue https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/32873
- [sloth-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/sloth-app) 
  - [1.7.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/sloth-app/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0) 
      * Upgrade to sloth 0.12.0.
- [coredns-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app) 
  - [1.25.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app/compare/v1.24.0...v1.25.0)
      * Update `coredns` image to [1.12.1](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.12.1).
- [proxysocks](https://github.com/giantswarm/proxysocks) 
  - [0.1.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/proxysocks/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1) 
      * Fix service selector in the Helm chart.
  - [0.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/proxysocks/releases/tag/v0.1.0) 
      * Initial release of the app.
      * Add support for credentials 


- [app](https://github.com/giantswarm/app) 
  - [8.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/app/compare/v7.1.0...v8.0.0) 
      * Changed `app.Validator` interface.
      * Replaced `projectName` string field with `isAdmissionController` boolean field.
      * Removed `enableManagedByLabel` field.
      * When `app.Validator.isAdmissionController` is enabled, the existence checks for referenced config maps and secrets under App CRs (`.spec.config`, `.spec.userConfig`, `.spec.kubeConfig.secret`) will be skipped. This makes the existence of the `giantswarm.io/managed-by` label irrelevant as that was used to produce this behaviour that is the default behaviour now.
      * Removed `key.IsManagedBy` function as it is not relevant anymore.
- [app-admission-controller](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-admission-controller) 
  - [2.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-admission-
controller/compare/v1.0.1...v2.0.0) 
      * Bump `app` library to `v8.0.0`.
### Remove
      * Remove existence checks for App CR referenced config maps and secrets under `.spec.config`, `.spec.userConfig`, `.spec.kubeConfig.secret`. Previously, it was possible to skip these checks by setting adding the label `giantswarm.io/managed-by` to the App CR with a non-empty value. Reason is moving towards eventual consistency and letting these checks fail at reconciliation as admission controller will anyway just run these checks on admission events only, and we have these checks "duplicated" in `app-operator`, where they should be.
- [app-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-operator) 
  - [7.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-operator/compare/v7.1.1...v7.2.0) 
      * Bump `app` library to `v8.0.0`.
      * Decrease default reconciliation interval from `5m` to `3m`.
      * Properly report missing referenced config maps and secrets in the status of the App CR.
- [cluster-apps-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-apps-operator) 
  - [3.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-apps-
operator/compare/v3.1.2...v3.2.0) 
      * Update `app-operator` to version `v7.2.0`.
- [konfigure-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure-operator) 
  - [0.1.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure-
operator/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2) 
      * Fix map filtering logic used to respect external annotations and labels on generated resources.
  - [0.1.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/konfigure-
operator/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1) 
      * Respect external labels on generated resources. An annotation or label is considered internal when it is prefixed with `configuration.giantswarm.io`. The state of internal annotations and labels is enforced on each reconciliation. 


- [image-distribution-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/image-distribution-operator) 
  - [0.2.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/image-distribution-
operator/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) 
      * Support exotic characters in password with `url.UserPassword`.
  - [0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/image-distribution-
operator/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) 
      * Exclude all non vSphere releases.
      * Add `imagesuffix` to location field to set a suffix on the uploaded VM template name. 


- [starboard-exporter](https://github.com/giantswarm/starboard-exporter) 
  - [0.8.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/starboard-
exporter/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) 
      * Address new code linter findings for golangci-lint v2.
      * Update Go version and various dependencies.
- [cluster-autoscaler-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-app) 
  - [1.30.4-gs2](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-
app/compare/v1.30.4-gs1...v1.30.4-gs2) 
      * Support adding additional labels to the `PodMonitor` resource via the `podMonitor.additionalLabels` value.
