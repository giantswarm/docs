## Docs

We're excited to announce the launch of our new [Docs Hub](https://docs.giantswarm.io), featuring up-to-date documentation for the Giant Swarm platform, now fully ready for `Cluster API`. While we've preserved our vintage documentation in a dedicated folder for reference, all content in the general documentation section is now accurate and current. We are committed to expanding and enhancing our documentation further in the coming weeks, and we warmly welcome all customer feedback to help us improve and complete our resources.
