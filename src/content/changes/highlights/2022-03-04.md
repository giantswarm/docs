## General

This week's highlights are (almost) all about access control.

We released the last of a series of changes that finally enable you to admit *non-admin users* to our web interface, given that your installation is switched to single sign-on already. Please read [our blog post](https://www.giantswarm.io/blog/welcoming-more-users-to-our-web-interface-giant-swarm) for details. We will get in contact with all customers who use single sign-on already to assist with establishing more fine-grained user roles and permissions.

## Apps

- Our [Dex](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/dex-app/v1.22.2/) app is now available in the Giant Swarm catalog, which means that we recommend it for production use in workload clusters. For customers who installed it from the Playground catalog, we updated the App CRs accordingly.
- We welcome our [RBAC bootstrap](https://github.com/giantswarm/rbac-bootstrap-app) app in the Giant Swarm catalog. It is a very simple app to allow configuring your initial RBAC bindings in a fresh workload cluster.

## User interfaces

- The web interface now fully adapts to the permissions a user has via the Management API.
- For AWS clusters, the instructions to inspect a workload cluster via `kubectl` has been fixed to actually work. Sorry about that!

## Documentation

- We added the article on [Authorization in the Management API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/authorization/) to explain where resources reside, which pre-defined roles are available and what they do, what additional automation is working behind the scenes, and how to put all of that to use based on typical use cases.
