## General

## Apps

### Security ~~Pack~~ Bundle
- **The App formerly known as `security-pack` has been renamed to `security-bundle`** to align its naming with our other bundles and keep our terminology consistent.
- [security-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-pack) version [0.13.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0130---2023-04-12) is a **major update containing multiple breaking changes** since the last release of the `security-pack`. **Please review the [instructions](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle#installing) in the README prior to attempting to upgrade**. This release includes the following noteworthy changes, as well as the App updates described in this announcement.
  - The `security-pack` App has been renamed to `security-bundle`.
  - `security-bundle` must be installed from the `giantswarm` catalog. It will no longer be published to `playground`.
  - The default installation namespace has been changed from `security-pack` to `security-bundle`. Custom installation namespaces are unaffected by this change.
  - The key `kyverno-policies` has been renamed to `kyvernoPolicies`. App value overrides for the `kyverno-policies` App must now be made under the `kyvernoPolicies` key.
  - `starboard-app` has been removed and is no longer installable from the `security-bundle`. Trivy Operator is installed by default and is a full replacement of Starboard. (`starboard-exporter` is still actively supported).
