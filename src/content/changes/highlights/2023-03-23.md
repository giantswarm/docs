## General

### Observability

* Prometheus-agent: New cluster releases contain a new component which enables us to monitor your cluster and provides the best quality of service. Some cluster upgrades might require manual intervention from our side, especially if you are using Prometheus Operator. Feel free to ask our team for any questions or help needed (@support-atlas). In case you want to know more details about why we introduced such a change please read our [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/observability/monitoring/prometheus/agent/).

* grafana explore: Grafana Explore feature is now enabled. This allow you to execute PromQL (and LogQL later) queries against metrics we collect from your clusters. See https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/observability/grafana/access/ https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/

* vertical-pod-autoscaler: v3.x is out which requires to update existing config. Also v3.2.0 improves resources usage as VPA now autoscales itself. Fee free to ask team-atlas for any questions or help needed. See [github.com/vertical-pod-autoscaler@v3.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/vertical-pod-autoscaler-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
