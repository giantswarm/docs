### Observability

- [Prometheus-agent](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-agent-app): New cluster releases contain a new component which enables us to monitor your cluster and provides the best quality of service. Some cluster upgrades might require manual intervention from our side, especially if you are using Prometheus Operator. Feel free to ask our team for any questions or help needed (@support-atlas). In case you want to know more details about why we introduced such a change please read our [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/observability/monitoring/prometheus/agent/).
- Grafana Explore: It is a new feature enabled in your Grafana installation. This allows you to execute PromQL (and LogQL later) queries against metrics we collect from your clusters. See [our docs for more information](https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/observability/grafana/access/ https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/)
- [Vertical-Pod-Autoscaler (VPA)](https://github.com/giantswarm/vertical-pod-autoscaler-app): New version [v.3.3.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/vertical-pod-autoscaler-app/releases/tag/v3.3.0) is our with new improvements. Highlight that now VPA auto-scales itself. This version requires updating the existing config.

This version includes performance improvements to increase the AdmissionReports processing speed and reduce the number of reports stored in the cluster.
- [Nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app) version [2.27.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2270---2023-03-22) is the second part of our upstream alignment epic. We have added seven helper properties, forty-three deployment properties and adapted our CI to be compliant. Before upgrading, please take care and read the [changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2270---2023-03-22) as there are some changes that should be done carefully. In the process of alignment, we have adapted other templates. Additionally, the `chart.yaml` has been aligned with upstream too. Last but not least, we removed some helpers and deployment properties not needed after the restructuring work. So, please be aware that some of these changes, additions or removals can require modifications from you. We encourage you to read the [changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2270---2023-03-22) for not to miss any information.
