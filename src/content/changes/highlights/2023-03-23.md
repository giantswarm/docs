Some cluster upgrade might require manual intervention from our side, especially if you are using prometheus-operator. Feel free to ask team-atlas for any questions or help needed, also more details like why is this needed and which cluster releases are affected can be found in our doc [here](https://docs.giantswarm.io/getting-started/observability/monitoring/prometheus/agent/).
