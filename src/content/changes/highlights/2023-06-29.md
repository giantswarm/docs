## General

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.14.9](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0149---2023-06-26) makes the policy-reporter scrape timeout and interval configurable to allow more collection time in clusters with many policies.
- [security-bundle](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle) version [1.0.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#101---2023-06-26) (and 1.0.0) is the first release intended to be installed by default on Kubernetes 1.25 and later. It disables PSPs in favor of enforced Kyverno PSS restricted policies. Clusters running Kubernetes v1.24 or earlier should continue using pre-1.0.0 bundle versions. Upcoming platform releases will include the `security-bundle` by default (see [important notes in the bundle readme](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/tree/main#installing)) and may require removing or modifying Kyverno or Security Bundle apps prior to upgrade.
