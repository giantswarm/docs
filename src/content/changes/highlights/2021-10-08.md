## Documentation

Terminology update: what has been called "master nodes" by the Kubernetes project in the past is now called the Control plane or the control plane nodes. We are aligning with these changes in our documentation as well as the user interfaces. Note that we are making an exception for gsctl and the Rest API, which we plan to phase out in the future.

## User interfaces

We have several important changes in `kubeclt gs`:

- The `template cluster` and `template nodepool` commands will automatically use the namespace of the organization owning the cluster.
- We added the command [`get releases`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-releases/) to fetch information on cluster releases.
- The `template nodepool` command now ensures the `giantswarm.io/machine-pool` labels for each worker node in a node pool, both on AWS and Azure.
