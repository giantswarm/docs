## General

This week we have updated cert-manager and added OIDC support on workload clusters via `dex` and `athena`.

## Apps
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app) version [v2.15.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2151---2022-07-07) Upgrades to upstream image [`v1.7.3`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.7.3) which increases some hard-coded timeouts for certain ACME issuers (ZeroSSL and Sectigo) ([#243](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/243)) and updates kubectl container version to `1.24.2` ([#243](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/pull/243))

## User interfaces
`kubectl gs login` now supports OIDC on workload clusters via `dex` and `athena`. Please check [the documentation on workload cluster OIDC configuration](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/access-management/configure-dex-in-your-cluster/) as well as [the login command reference](https://docs.giantswarm.io/vintage/use-the-api/kubectl-gs/login/) to find out more.
