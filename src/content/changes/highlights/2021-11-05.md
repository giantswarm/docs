## Documentation

- A new article on [managing workload clusters with GitOps](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/), explaining how to use Flux in our management clusters.
- Added documentation for handling [cloud provider credentials](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/credentials/) via the Management API (for AWS).
- If you've been trying to figure out how to use `kubectl gs login` with workload clusters, the [docs article](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/kubectl-gs/login/) now provides more detailed information and better examples.

## User interfaces

- Our web interface is now fully migrated to the Management API on AWS. So customers who already switched to single sign-on will notice some UI improvements.
- `gsctl` adds more information about deprecated commands. Make sure to use the latest version.
