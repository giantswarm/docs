## Apps

- [dex-k8s-authenticator](https://github.com/giantswarm/dex-k8s-authenticator) component is now deprecated and disabled by default due to the upstream project no longer being maintained. We advise switching to use [kubectl gs login](https://docs.giantswarm.io/vintage/use-the-api/kubectl-gs/login/) for access. Please reach out if you need any support regarding the access mechanism.
- [external-dns-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app) version [v.3.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/releases/tag/v3.1.0) removes the default namespace filter configuration. This was an relict from times where nginx-ingress was bound the the kube-system namespace and now got lifted.
- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) version [v1.3.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v1.3.1) corrects installation issues from the v1.2.0 release where in certain scenarios controllers were unable to start due to PSPs still being available on the clusters. This version of the app also improves monitoring of the flux controllers. Customers who are using the [v1.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v1.2.0) release should upgrade to this new version at the earliest convenience. Please reach out if you need any support regarding the upgrade.
