## User interfaces

The customer cluster admin group and `default:automation` service account have now access to Flux logs for debugging issues with the flux system.

## Apps

[flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) version [v0.16.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0160---2022-10-04) upgrades to support Flux toolkit [v0.35.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.35.0). **Breaking changes**: from Flux [v0.34.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.34.0) onward, Flux controller logs have been aligned with the Kubernetes structured logging, further details [here](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/3051). From Flux [v0.35.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.35.0), strict validation rules have been put in place for API fields which define a time duration, so values without a time unit (e.g. `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`) will now be rejected by the API server.
