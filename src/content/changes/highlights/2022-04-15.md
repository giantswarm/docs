## General

## Apps

## User interfaces

When installing apps into workload clusters via the web UI, it is now much easier to see what cluster you are installing to. Also we are displaying in the catalog which apps are installed in that cluster already.

## Documentation

We improved our [kubectl-gs installation instructions](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/installation/) so they are easier to follow and we added info for ARM binaries for Linux and macOS.
