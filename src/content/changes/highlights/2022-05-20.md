## User interfaces

Via the web UI, you can now not only inspect your own permissions for the Management API. As an admin, you can also *inspect permissions for a specific group or user*. If you use the web UI with single sign-on, please try it out! You'll find the function in the user menu (top right) under *Permissions*.

The `kubectl gs get apps` command output now provides a new column `NOTES` where you can find useful information in case a deployment of an app failed. Check the [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-apps/) for an example.

`kubectl gs login` for creating a workload cluster certificate now supports arbitrary context names, in case you don't want to name them after our convention, starting with a `gs-`.
