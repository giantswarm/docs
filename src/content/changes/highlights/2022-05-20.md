## User interfaces

Via the web UI, you can not not only inspect your own permissions for the Management API. As an admin, you can also *inspect permissions for a specific group or user*. If you use the web UI with single sign-on, please try it out! You'll find the function in the user menu (top right) under *Permissions*.
