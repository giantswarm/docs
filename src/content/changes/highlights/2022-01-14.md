## User interfaces

If you haven't done so yet, please upgrade your kubectl-gs version to 1.58.2, to prevent an issue with the `login` command when creating workload cluster certificates.

In the web UI on KVM installations, we fixed a problem that prevented clusters from being deleted. Also the number of apps with a pending upgrade is now calculated correctly.
