## Managed apps

[NGINX IC v2.0.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/nginx-ingress-controller-app/v2.0.0/) is upgraded to controller container image v0.48.1. It contains performance improvements related to the admission webhook. **Potentially Breaking change**: For security, it disables forwarding traffic to ExternalNameServices by default. To enable it please check the details in the [changelog](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/nginx-ingress-controller-app/v2.0.0/).

[Prometheus Operator v0.9.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/prometheus-operator-app/v0.9.0/) uses `giantswarm/config` to generate managed configuration. This is part of a larger [story](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/121) to automate the configuration management of installations.

## User interfaces



## Documentation

With release v15.0.0 for Azure you can now specify which external IP address to use for egress traffic of workloads, and we just added [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/egress-ip-address-azure/) for this feature.
