## General

## User interfaces

- [kubectl-gs v2.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) has been released, removing some old flags that were previously deprecated and replaced by others. Also adding some options to the `template app` command.

## Apps

- [external-dns-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/) [v2.9.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#291---2022-02-03) allows for setting the AWS default region independently from any other value.
- [flux-app version 0.9.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v0.9.0) has been release with support for variable substitution.


## Documentation

- As our next releases for AWS and Azure will provide cgroups v2, which is known to conflict with some applications (especially older Java runtime environments), we provide documentation on [how to activate cgroups v1 in selected node pools](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/forcing-cgroupsv1/).
- We extended our documentation for the [`kubectl gs login`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/login/#workload-cluster) command to provide more information for accessing workload clusters.
- Improved the [GitOps documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/#setting-up-sources) around Role-Based Access and how it ties in to Management API.
