## General

## Feedback wanted

## Apps

- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) [v0.17.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/releases/tag/v0.17.0) updates Flux toolkit to [v0.36.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.36.0), which includes a fix that reduces kustomize-controller's memory usage by 90%. It contains no breaking changes.

## User interfaces

- You now have the ability to view logs from all pods on the management clusters, enabling an additional degree of self-service towards debugging deployments that may be failing for reasons which are not clear from the resource status field. These logs can be accessed with `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

## Documentation

In our [changes and releases section](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/), you will from now on find information on changes to cluster apps, starting with AWS, GCP, and OpenStack.
