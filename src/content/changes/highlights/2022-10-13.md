## General

## App Platform

- [chart-operator v2.31.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/chart-operator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2310---2022-10-07) introduces changes making it possible to install both, CRDs and CRs, in a single-step for some apps. Apps must though be enabled for this.

## User interfaces

- [kubectl-gs v2.24.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.24.1) fixes a problem in `kubectl gs login`. On some operating systems the program would wait for the browser application, which it launched for the authentication flow, to close again.
- Adjusted `kubectl gs login` command to ensure that it writes to the main kubeconfig file only in case there are actual changes in the content of the file.

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.11.3](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0113---2022-10-07) updates to Kyverno version 1.7.4 and policy-reporter version 2.10.0.
- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app) version [v0.16.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0161---2022-10-11) makes the app subject to CRDs and CRs installation in a single step.
