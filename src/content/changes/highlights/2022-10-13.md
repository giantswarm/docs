## User interfaces

[kubectl-gs v2.24.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.24.2) fixes several problems with `kubectl gs login`:

- For some Linux users the program would wait for the browser application, which it launched for the authentication flow, to close again. In case you would not close the browser window, the process could never finish.
- Previous versions used to write to the kubeconfig file even if no changes were made. This could cause issues when using kubectl gs in parallel. We made changes to ensure that the kubeconfig is only touched if there are changes.

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.11.3](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0113---2022-10-07) updates to Kyverno version 1.7.4 and policy-reporter version 2.10.0.
