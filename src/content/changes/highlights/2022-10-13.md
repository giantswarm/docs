## General


## User interfaces

- [kubectl-gs v2.24.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.24.1) fixes a problem in `kubectl gs login`. On some operating systems the program would wait for the browser application, which it launched for the authentication flow, to close again.
- Adjusted `kubectl gs login` command to ensure that it writes to the main kubeconfig file only in case there are actual changes in the content of the file.

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.11.3](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0113---2022-10-07) updates to Kyverno version 1.7.4 and policy-reporter version 2.10.0.
