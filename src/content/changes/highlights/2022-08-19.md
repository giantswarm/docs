## User interfaces

We fixed a problem in our web UI that has prevented some non-admin users from logging in. In addition, in the list of apps installed in a cluster, it is now easier to spot the ones that are not in the expected "Deployed" state.

## Apps

- [kyverno-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app) version [v0.11.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0110---2022-08-17) updates to upstream version 1.7.2, containing several resilience and performance improvements.
- [security-pack](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-pack) version [v0.6.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-pack/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#060---2022-08-17) includes the latest Kyverno app release (v0.11.0) as well as minor updates to Starboard exporter (v0.5.1) and Trivy (v0.28.1).
- [nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app) version [v2.15.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2152---2022-08-15) adds support for labels on the metrics service.
- [linkerd2-multicluster-link-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd2-multicluster-link-app) version [0.7.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd2-multicluster-link-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#072---2022-08-16) adds support for pre-created service accounts.
- [flux-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/) version [v0.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0140---2022-08-18) moves back to manage Flux CRDs via Jobs instead of native Helm 3 support added in `v0.13.0`. We added [important installation notes](https://github.com/giantswarm/flux-app/blob/master/README.md#important-installation-notes) to the project's README.md to clarify the benefits and limitations of this approach. We recommend skipping `v0.13.0` and use `v0.14.0` instead.
