## User interfaces

As of the latest version, our web UI is ready for use on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) installations.

kubectl-gs [v2.23.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubectl-gs/releases/tag/v2.23.0) adds the capability to create a client certificate for workload cluster access with a specific CN prefix. This means you can bind the client presenting this certificate to an RBAC role as a user. Check the `login` command's new `--cn-prefix` flag.

## Documentation

We now have a dedicated page clarifying the concept and value of [app bundles](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/app-bundle/) and its place in the app platform.
