## Nginx Ingress Controller 

We have spent the last months reworking our [nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app) by aligning it to the [upstream ingress-nginx]u(https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) project. This is necessary to be future-proof, feature compliant, and offer the best ingress experience possible. Therefore we want to announce the first public beta release of our new `ingress-nginx chart`.

The stable release v3.0.0 will be cut as soon as all possible bugs have been fixed and improvements have been implemented. For our  [beta release](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1) we added all changes mentioned in our [alpha1 release](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha1).

To have a flawless experience we wrote a [migration guide](https://github.com/giantswarm/ingress-nginx-app/blob/v3.0.0-beta1/migration.md). This guide contains a step-by-step guide which replaces your old app deployment to upgrade the chart without any major outages. 

All feedback and questions regarding the beta relase, its changes and our migration guide are very welcome.
