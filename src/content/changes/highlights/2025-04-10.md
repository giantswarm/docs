We're going back to installing the kong OSS version by default instead of
enterprise. In case you're relying on this default behaviour, please make sure
to set the `.Values.image.repository`, `.Values.image.tag`,
`.Values.enterprise.enabled` and `.Values.enterprise.license_secret` values to
the respective Enterprise values.
