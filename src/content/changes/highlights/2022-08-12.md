## User interfaces

For apps installed in a workload cluster, the web UI now shows the name of the App resource (in case it's not identical with the app's name in the catalog). This makes it easier to distinguish several apps of the same type, e. g. if you have NGINX Ingress controller installed multiple times.

We also improved the display of an App resources' deployment status.

kubectl-gs since version 2.19.0 consistently supports flags related to the kubectl config in all commands, including `--kubeconfig` for the path to a config file, `--context` for selecting a context, `--cluster`, `--user` etc.

## Documentation

We added [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/tls-certificates/) on how to use cert-manager to automatically obtain TLS certificates for ingresses.
