## General

As we aim to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where possible, we started replacing the term _master node_ with _control plane node_.

## Managed apps

[Loki v0.2.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/loki-app/v0.2.0/) comes with upstream version 2.2.1. Please note that there is a manual intervention required when upgrading to this version. Check the release info for details.

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` as of v1.28.0 offers two new commands: [`get appcatalogs`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-appcatalogs/) and [`get apps`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-apps/).
