## General

As we aim to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where possible, we started replacing the term _master node_ with _control plane node_.

## Managed apps

## Apps supported with best effort

## Management API

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` as of v1.28.0 offers two new commands: [`get appcatalogs`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-appcatalogs/) and [`get apps`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-apps/).
