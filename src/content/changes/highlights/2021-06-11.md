## General

As we aim to align our terminology with the Kubernetes project where possible, we started replacing the term _master node_ with _control plane node_ in our communication and user interfaces.

## Managed apps

[Loki v0.2.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/loki-app/v0.2.0/) comes with upstream version 2.2.1. You can now use an existing secret (such as sealed secrets) for configuration, making the app more flexible. Please note that there is a manual intervention required when upgrading to this version. Check the release info for details.

[Kong v2.1.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/kong-app/v2.1.0/) is upgraded to upstream chart v2.1.0. We anticipate some Kong issues to be fixed by upgrading.

[NGINX IC v1.17.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/nginx-ingress-controller-app/v1.17.0/) updates the controller container image to v0.47.0.

[External DNS v2.4.0](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/managed-apps/external-dns-app/v2.4.0/) is upgraded to v0.8.0.

## User interfaces

`kubectl gs` as of v1.28.0 offers two new commands: [`get appcatalogs`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-appcatalogs/) and [`get apps`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/kubectl-gs/get-apps/).
