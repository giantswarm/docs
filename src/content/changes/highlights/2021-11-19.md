## Apps

AWS LB Controller is now available! Find it in the managed apps catalog.

oauth2-proxy version v7.2.0 is now available, as well as support for configuring extra arguments (per provider, or for all providers).

## User interfaces

In the Web UI, we now guide users to create a node pool after cluster creation.

On AWS in the node pool creation UI - spot instances are now disabled by default and can be enabled by toggling "Enable spot instances" in the node pool creation form.

Added `--self-contained` flag to `kubectl-gs login` command for workload clusters to allow the output of standalone kubeconfig file.  This file can be passed on to other users without management cluster access.

You can now specify a Service Account token when logging in, to help automation use cases.

## Documentation

Added [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/cost-optimization/workload-clusters-scale-down/) on how to scale down workload clusters and silence alerts for a specified period of time. This can be used, for example, to limit workload clusters costs.
