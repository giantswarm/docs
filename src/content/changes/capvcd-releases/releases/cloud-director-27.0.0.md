title: Workload cluster release cloud-director-27.0.0 for CAPVCD
---

We are happy to announce the first release for VMware Cloud Director that uses the new release framework.

## Migration to new releases flow

In order to consume the new flow, the following two fields need to be manually adapted:

* In ConfigMap `<cluster name>-userconfig` set `.Values.global.release.version` to the release version, e.g. `27.0.0`.
* In App `<cluster name>` remove the `spec.version` field. In case of GitOps, Flux might complain that the app manifest is invalid as the `spec.version` field is mandatory. In that case, edit the live App CR and set `spec.version` to an empty string. That will unblock Flux and allow it reconcile successfully.

And if you want to use `kubectl-gs` to create a cluster, you'd need to now specify the release version, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl-gs template cluster --provider cloud-director --organization my_org --name cluster_name --release 27.0.0
```
