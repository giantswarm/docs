### Added
- Add Network Traffic Analysis Overview dashboard
### Changed
- Improve Network Traffic Analysis Dashboard Performance
  - [performance] Re-use panel queries, which gladly reduces the number of queries made to the backend, and ease maintenance
  - [performance] Change Pie Charts query types from range to instant
  - [performance] Set maximum datapoints to 500 and minimal interval to 2mn
  - [ux] Change destination pie charts to only show top 10 destinations
  - [ux] Change the top list panels to use pagination rather than only showing top 10 elements
  - [ux] Change bottom graphs to use stacked lines and added list of values + total count
  - [ux] Remove the per-namespace section which was merely a duplicate of the top one with additional namespace filter. All panels now have a namespace filter which default to all namespace, therefore keeping the old behavior of the top panels and also allowing behavior of the bottom ones at the same time.
  - [ux] Add links between both Network Traffic Analysis dashboards
  - [ux] Add `Include non-namespaced` toggle to filter/include non-namespaced network traffic
  - [ux] Improve documentation panel
  - [ux] Add annotations for CiliumNetworkPolicies events
  - [ux] Change Legend set to "unknown" when no value is found
  - [ux] Show percentage and all values in tooltip on destination panels
  - [maintenance] Move subnets regex to a constant
- NGINX Ingress controller dashboard: reworked variables
  - removed `app` selector
  - removed `namespace` selector
  - added `ingress namespace` selector
### Removed
- Remove `logging-operator` related data as it is now deprecated.
