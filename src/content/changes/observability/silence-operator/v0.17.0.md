title: silence-operator release v0.17.0
---

### Added
- Add advanced filtering capabilities for both v1alpha1 and v1alpha2 controllers:
  - Add silence selector feature to filter `Silence` resources by labels (configure via `--silence-selector` flag).
  - Add namespace selector for v1alpha2 controller to restrict watched namespaces (configure via `--namespace-selector` flag).
- Allow filtering of `Silence` custom resources based on a label selector. The operator will only process `Silence` CRs that match the selector provided via the `--silence-selector` command-line flag or the `silenceSelector` Helm chart value. If no selector is provided, all `Silence` CRs are processed.
- Add new `observability.giantswarm.io/v1alpha2` API with namespace-scoped Silence CRD for improved multi-tenancy.
  - Add `MatchType` enum field using Alertmanager operator symbols (`=`, `!=`, `=~`, `!~`) for intuitive matching logic.
  - Add `SilenceV2Reconciler` controller to handle v1alpha2 resources while maintaining full backward compatibility with v1alpha1.
  - Add comprehensive field validation: matcher names (1-256 chars), values (max 1024 chars), minimum 1 matcher required.
  - Add printer columns to v1alpha2 CRD for better `kubectl get silences` output showing Age.
- Add automated migration script (`hack/migrate-silences.sh`) for v1alpha1 to v1alpha2 conversion.
  - Automatically converts boolean matcher fields (`isRegex`/`isEqual`) to enum format (`matchType`).
  - Intelligently preserves user annotations/labels while filtering out Kubernetes and FluxCD system metadata.
  - Supports dry-run mode for safe migration testing.
- Add comprehensive migration documentation (`MIGRATION.md`) with examples and best practices.
- Add clean service layer architecture (`pkg/service/`) separating business logic from Kubernetes controller concerns.
### Changed
- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Replace `isRegex` and `isEqual` boolean fields with single `matchType` enum field using Alertmanager symbols.
- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Change from cluster-scoped to namespace-scoped resources for better multi-tenancy and RBAC isolation.
- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Remove deprecated fields in v1alpha2: `targetTags`, `owner`, `postmortem_url`, and `issue_url` for cleaner API design.
- Improve code organization with dependency injection and clear separation between controller logic and business logic.
### Deprecated
- The `monitoring.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1` API is now considered legacy. New deployments should use `observability.giantswarm.io/v1alpha2`.
**Migration Note**: Existing v1alpha1 silences continue to work unchanged. Use the automated migration script and see MIGRATION.md for detailed guidance.
