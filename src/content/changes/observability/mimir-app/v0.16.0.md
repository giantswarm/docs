### Changed
- Upgrade chart to version 5.6.0
  - Add the possibility to create a dedicated serviceAccount for the alertmanager component by setting alertmanager.serviceAcount.create to true in the values.
  - Add support for setting type and internal traffic policy for Kubernetes service. Set internalTrafficPolicy=Cluster by default in all services with type ClusterIP.

- Upgrade mimir to 2.15.0
  - Ingester: Change -initial-delay for circuit breakers to begin when the first request is received, rather than at breaker activation.
  - Query-frontend: apply query pruning before query sharding instead of after.
  - Ingester: Replace cortex_discarded_samples_total label from sample-out-of-bounds to sample-timestamp-too-old.
  - Querier: The `.` pattern in regular expressions in PromQL matches newline characters. With this change regular expressions like `.*` match strings that include `\n`. To maintain the old behaviour, you will have to change regular expressions by replacing all `.` patterns with `[^\n]`, e.g. `foo[^\n]*`. This upgrades PromQL compatibility from Prometheus 2.0 to 3.0. #9844
  - Ingester: improve performance of reading the WAL.
  - Querier: improve performance and memory consumption of queries that select many series.
