### Changed
WARNING: this version requires Cilium to run because of the dependency on the CiliumNetworkPolicy CRD
- Upgrade dependency chart to 9.2.0.
- Adjusted the resource and limits to accomodate larger clusters by default
- Adjusted the admission controller to give it more QPS against the API
- Adjusted the updater to give it more QPS against the API
- Adjusted the recommender to give it
  - more QPS against the API
  - doubling the memory in case of an OOMKilled event
  - Using the 95% percentile for the calculation of the CPU usage: should allow to scale up more precisely to account for spikes in CPU consumption of the workload
  - Adjusted the resource and limits to accomodate larger clusters by default
  - Calculating recommendations only for workloads which do have a VPA custom resource, instead of all workloads
  - Removed standard network policies to decrease maintenance burden
  - Fixed Cilium Network Policy to allow CRD jobs execution
  - Added Cilium Network Policy weight for an early execution
  - Disabled VPA for the updater pod otherwise it keeps on getting re-scheduled because the memory consumption varies a lot between reconsiling resources and idle
  - Disabled VPA for the recommender pod otherwise it keeps on getting re-scheduled because the memory consumption varies a lot between reconsiling resources and idle
