### Added
- Basic usage tracking data is now collected for every command execution. This should help us maintain and develop the tool. Set the `KUBECTL_GS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to an arbitrary value to disable this. Data is submitted to [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) in the EU. More details are available in our [docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/vintage/use-the-api/kubectl-gs/telemetry/).
