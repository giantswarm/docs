### Changed
- Add `giantswarm.io/cluster` label to the 'default-apps' bundle so that it's deleted when a `Cluster` is deleted.
- Deprecated `--enable-long-names` flag and added support for generating and validating long resource names (up to 10 characters) by default.
- Add option to reference the `cluster-values` configmap in the `App` CR created for CAPI clusters.
