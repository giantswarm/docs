- Add cert SANs for 127.0.0.1 and localhost to api-server to support Giant
  Swarm App Platform bootstrap mode.
- Allow setting etcd image repository and tag.
- Set the default etcd version to 3.5.4 (kubeadm default is 3.5.0 which is not
  recommended in production).
- Set the default etcd image to retagged Giant Swarm one.
### Changed

- Remove versioned labels from MachineSpec to prevent unnecessary rollouts.
