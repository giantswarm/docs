title: Tenant Cluster Release v11.2.0 for AWS
---

This release adds support for [EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) in your node pools to allow reduction of your compute resource cost. Find details on how to use spot instances [in our node pools documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/#instance-distribution).

Our web UI has been updated to support the new features of this release. Users of  [`gsctl`](https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl), please update to the latest v0.20.0.

If you intend to use spot instances, be aware that an AWS service limit called `EC2 Spot Instances` is effective. In order to prepare for growth, you should request an increase for this limit for all instance types you would like to use.

## aws-operator [v8.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-operator/releases/tag/v8.4.0)

- Add support for instance distribution between spot and on-demand in worker node Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).
- Add mixed instance support for worker node Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).

## cluster-operator [v2.1.9](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-operator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#219-2020-04-23)
