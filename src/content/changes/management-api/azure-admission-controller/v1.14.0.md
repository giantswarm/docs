### Added
- Ignore release in validation logic by setting `release.giantswarm.io/ignore` annotation on a `Release` CR.
- Validate Organization label for `AzureMachinePool` and `MachinePool` match `Cluster`'s.
- Make Pod terminate itself when the TLS certificate is expired.
### Changed
- Update `apptest` library and CAPZ fork dependencies.
- On upgrade ignore alpha releases when validating new cluster release version, because upgrading to or from an alpha release is not supported.
