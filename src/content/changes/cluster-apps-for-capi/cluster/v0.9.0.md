description: Changelog entry for giantswarm/cluster version 0.9.0, published on 21

title: cluster release v0.9.0
---

### Added
- Add default HelmRepositories (behind a flag which is disabled by default).
- Add vertical-pod-autoscaler-crd HelmRelease (behind a flag which is disabled by default).
- Add coredns HelmRelease (behind a flag which is disabled by default).
- Support prepending cluster name to file secret name
### Changed
- Set `--node-ip` kubelet argument also for joining control plane nodes. Other nodes already had this setting, and it is important if a node has multiple network interfaces (such as for Cilium ENI mode or AWS VPC CNI). Only the primary IP will be reported in the node status, resulting in `kubectl exec` and other tooling working correctly.
- Put API server priority and fairness configuration behind a flag that is disabled by default.
