title: cluster release v0.31.0

### Added
- This PR adds support for using Release CRs and getting Kubernetes, Flatcar and apps version, catalog and dependencies
  from there. This change is fully backward compatible, and it requires that new flag `$.Values.providerIntegration.useReleases`
  is set to `true`. The default value of `$.Values.providerIntegration.useReleases` is `false`, so cluster chart version
  can be safely updated.
