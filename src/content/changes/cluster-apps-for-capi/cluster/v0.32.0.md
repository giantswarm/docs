### Added
- Add `.global.components.containerd.localRegistryCache` Helm values and support for in-cluster, local registry cache mirrors in `containerd` configuration.
  In such cases, the registry should be exposed via node ports and `containerd` connects via that port at `127.0.0.1` via HTTP (only allowed for this single use case).
