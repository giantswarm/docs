### Changed
- No major change in `v0.50.0`, except that we are moving to a [release based upgrade cycle](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/3392) with Kubernetes version, VM template and other defaults are set in the chart values. They shouldn't be overridden as they are managed by Giant Swarm.
- Bump `kube-vip` to `v0.8.0`.
