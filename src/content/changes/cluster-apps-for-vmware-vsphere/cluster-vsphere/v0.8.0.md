### Added
- Add IPv4 addresses management (ipam) for WC's `kube-vip-cloud-provider`. If the ipPool is specified, currently one IP is requested from it
and is added to the end of the list for this controller. `kube-vip-cloud-provider` is part of our Service-lvl load balancer solution in WC and
at least 1 public IP is always needed for the ingress controller to be able to expose its stuff.
