### Added
- Add `.global.connectivity.localRegistryCache` Helm values and support for in-cluster, local registry cache mirrors in containerd configuration.
  In such cases, the registry should be exposed via node ports and containerd connects via that port at 127.0.0.1 via HTTP (only allowed for this single use case).
### Fixed
- Fixed `containerd` config file generation when multiple registries are set with authentication
### Removed
- Stop setting `defaultPolicies.enabled=true` in `cilium-app` when `internal.ciliumNetworkPolicy.enabled=true` after all clusters are migrated.
- Stop setting `extraPolicies.remove=true` in `cilium-app` after all clusters are migrated.
