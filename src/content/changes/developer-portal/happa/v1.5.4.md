## What's changed

Happa has had some changes which will not be immediately visible to customers. 

These are all part of our move to eventually enable identity provider based log in for all users of Happa, and in doing so, also allow Happa to communicate directly with the k8s API of the installation.

Giant Swarm staff is testing and validating the changes. Customers will be invited to log in using an identity provider when the documentation and communication around this is more developed.
