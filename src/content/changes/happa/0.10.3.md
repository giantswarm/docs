title: happa Release v0.10.3

## Changes
- We removed the BETA tag next to the notice that lists refresh. This was
intended to indicate that the refreshing of lists was still an experiment.
Happa itself is not in BETA.

- Some of our labels flash to indicate that new data has arrived, this used
to be triggered on first view of those labels. We've changed that so now they
only flash when new data comes in, instead of at initial viewing.

## Bugfixes
- We fixed an issue with loading of the app catalog.
