title: default-apps-aws release v0.52.0
---

### Added
- Helm value `.Values.deleteOptions.moveAppsHelmOwnershipToClusterAws` that enables migration of apps from default-apps-aws to cluster-aws (apps are paused, so they are not removed from the WC when default-apps-aws is deleted).
### Fixed
- Downgrade vertical-pod-autoscaler to v5.1.0 due to a bug in newer version that causes the updater to panic.
