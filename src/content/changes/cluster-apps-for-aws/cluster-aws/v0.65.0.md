### Fixed
- Pass `clusterID` to `aws-ebs-csi-driver` app's values for volume tagging purposes.
### Changed
- Change image lookup format for base OS image. osImageVariant is set to "2" for this kubernetes version. This is a **breaking change** that requires manual steps. For the next kubernetes versions, osImageVariant should not be set.
