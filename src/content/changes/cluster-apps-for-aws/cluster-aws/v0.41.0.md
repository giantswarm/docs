title: cluster-aws release v0.41.0
---

⚠️ When upgrading, please use v0.41.0 (_this release_) or newer. See our note on the breaking change in v0.38.4.
### Fixed
- Accept old service account issuer URI without `https://` prefix as well. This fixes the breaking change introduced in v0.38.4. Existing service account tokens, and the operators/applications using them, will keep working even before the tokens get rotated with the new service account issuer URI. When upgrading, it is recommended to skip earlier releases and immediately jump from v0.38.3 (or older) to _this one_.
