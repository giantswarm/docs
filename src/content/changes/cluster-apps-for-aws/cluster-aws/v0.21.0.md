### Breaking Change
- For private clusters, where `network.vpcMode` is set to `private`, the subnets property has changed. Instead of previously being a list of CIDR strings the property now include a more complex object providing more configuration options. For migration steps see the "Upgrading to `v0.21.0`" section in the readme.
### Added
- More configuration options when defining subnets to be created
- `controlPlane.subnetTags`, `bastion.subnetTags` and `machinePools[].subnetTags` to target specific subnets
- Add icon to Chart.yaml
### Changed
- Subnets are now specified on the `AWSCluster` resource by default rather than relying on CAPA code to default them. The same sizing as the CAPA default have been used.
