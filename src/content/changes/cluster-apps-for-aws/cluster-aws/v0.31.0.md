### Changed
- Rename `defaultMachinePools` to `internal.nodePools` to fit new schema requirements and make clear that it should not be changed by customers
- Default to using `giantswarm.azurecr.io` as Docker Hub mirror
### Fixed
- Remove duplicate label `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` in bastion MachineDeployment
### Removed
- Remove `image-pull-progress-deadline` kubelet flag, as it's Docker only, and it's removed in k8s v1.24+.
