### ⚠️ Breaking change
- Update cluster chart to v0.25.0 and enable all default apps. More details in [cluster chart v0.24.0 release notes](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/releases/tag/v0.24.0).
Cluster upgrade steps are the following:
- Upgrade default-apps-aws App to v0.52.0 or newer.
- Update default-apps-aws Helm value `.Values.deleteOptions.moveAppsHelmOwnershipToClusterAws` to true.
  - All apps, except observability-bundle and security-bundle will get `app-operator.giantswarm.io/paused: true` annotation, so wait few minutes for the change to get applied by the Helm post-upgrade hook.
- Delete default-apps-aws.
  - App resources for all default apps will get deleted. Wait few minutes for this to happen.
  - Chart resources on the workload cluster will stay, so all apps will continue running. 
- Upgrade cluster-aws App to v0.76.0.
  - cluster-aws will deploy all default apps, wait a few minutes for all Apps to be successfully deployed.
  - Chart resources on the workload cluster will get updated, as newly deployed App resources will take over the reconciliation of the existing Chart resources.
### Added
- Chart: Add `aws-pod-identity-webhook` app. ([#581](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws/pull/581)).
