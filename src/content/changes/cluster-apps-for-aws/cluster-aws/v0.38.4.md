title: cluster-aws release v0.38.4
---

⚠️ We advise not to upgrade from v0.38.3 (or older) to v0.38.4. Please use v0.41.0 or newer which ensures that both the old and new service account issuer URIs are allowed (difference is only the `https://` prefix, which is a breaking change), avoiding that operators lose access to the Kubernetes API which could render the cluster unhealthy.
### Changed
- Add `https://` scheme prefix to service-account-issuer URI
