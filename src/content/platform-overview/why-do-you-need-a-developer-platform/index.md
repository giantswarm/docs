## Organizational Efficiency and Innovation

A self-service and cloud-native developer platform can improve organizational efficiency and enable innovation in several ways. First, it allows developers to easily provision, manage, and deploy their applications without the need for extensive IT support. This reduces the time and resources required for development and deployment, which can lead to faster time to market and improved productivity. Additionally, a cloud-native developer platform can provide scalable and reliable infrastructure, which is essential for supporting the rapid growth and constant evolution of modern applications.

## Open Source and Sustainable

Making the platform open-source can also provide several benefits. By sharing the source code with the community, organizations can benefit from the contributions and expertise of other developers, which can help to improve the platform and drive innovation. Additionally, open-source platforms are typically more secure, transparent and accountable, which can foster trust and collaboration within the engineering teams.

## Managed and Reliable

Managing a self-service and cloud-native developer platform can be complex and require a skilled team of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). SREs are responsible for ensuring the platform is reliable, scalable, and secure, which requires a deep understanding of the underlying infrastructure and software systems. They also play a key role in defining and implementing best practices for development, deployment, and monitoring, which can help to ensure the platform is effective and efficient. In short, having a good team of SREs is essential for ensuring the success and longevity of a self-service and cloud-native developer platform.

## What parts does a cloud-native developer platform consist of typically?

1. Container Orchestration: This typically includes tools like Kubernetes to manage and scale applications across multiple cloud environments.

2. Continuous Integration & Delivery: Allowing developers to continuously build, test and deploy code.

3. Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services: This part of the platform helps developers create and manage cloud resources, such as databases, message queues and other services that are complex to manage.

4. Security and Compliance: Security is an important element of any cloud-native platform. This includes tools to secure applications from threats such as malicious code, denial of service attacks, and data leakage.

5. Monitoring and Logging: Monitoring and logging solutions to help track and troubleshoot applications and services.
