We offer linkerd for service mesh functionality in the platform. You can still use other service meshes within the platform but linkerd comes managed by Giant Swarm.

To install, go to [Linkerd Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/giantswarm/linkerd-control-plane-app/blob/main/README.md#quickstart-guide).
