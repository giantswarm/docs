<!-- AUDIENCE: HIGH LEVEL, like a C-level person intro -->

Check first the template (https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/pull/2180/files) it is still on development and you feedback is welcome, but you can take it as a reference.

Concepts come to my mind when I think on security (worthy to mention here without going deep):

- RBAC
- policies
- runtime detection
- cloud security posture
- image scanning and provenance
- secret mgmt within the cluster
- traffic encryption

Write a brief description of the security in general from introductory point of view.

## Features

Describe what use cases are covered by the our security features.

## Cloud-native technologies

- What technologies are used to provide security to the workloads/cluster? (trivy, kyverno, ...)
