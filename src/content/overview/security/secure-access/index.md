You've got secure access to your workload clusters by default. To provide you with the best support, our team at Giant Swarm also needs access to these clusters.

We'll walk you through how this access works and the security measures we've put in place to make sure your clusters are managed securely and responsibly.

## Intro

Let's talk about the two types of access to your Giant Swarm clusters:

1. User access - this is for you and your team to interact with your services.

2. Admin access - this is for our team to help with management, development, and support.

## User access

We expose the Kubernetes API of each workload cluster to you. You can [manage who gets access by connecting your external identity provider]({{< relref "/overview/architecture/authentication" >}}) to the Kubernetes API.

## Admin access via Teleport

### What is Teleport?

[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) is an open-source tool that helps us manage secure access to your infrastructure. It uses an identity-aware reverse proxy and short-lived certificates instead of passwords or long-lived keys. This makes your clusters more secure and helps us follow regulations and work with different network setups.

Teleport is awesome because it:

- Requires no open ports, publicly routable machines, or privileged bastion hosts
- Works flexibly with our range of different customer network layouts
- Requires only outbound HTTPS traffic
- Uses short-lived, tightly scoped credentials
- Provides detailed audit logging to us and to our customers

### Teleport at Giant Swarm

We've made Teleport our go-to solution for accessing the infrastructure we manage. It gives us better audit and access logs than we had before. The best part? Teleport identity-aware reverse proxy with TLS routing makes everything more straightforward and secure. You don't need a VPN anymore, and you don't have to open extra ports in your network. It works smoothly behind corporate firewallsâ€”all you need is outbound HTTPS traffic to our Teleport cluster.

### Teleport secured access points

We use Teleport to securely access:

- **SSH** - Node access is proxied through Teleport, which authenticates the user and records the session without requiring personal SSH keys on customer machines.
- **Kubernetes API** - Management cluster and workload cluster Kubernetes API server access is auditable and can be fully private.
- **Apps** - User interfaces for Giant Swarm apps are also proxied and protected by Teleport, minimizing the number of components that require public endpoints.

Here's a diagram that shows how our Teleport setup works:

We secure Teleport access with GitHub SSO and multi-factor authentication. Only people in our GitHub organization can log in.

We've built our Teleport cluster to be super reliable, and we keep detailed access and audit logs for every session.

### Infrastructure provider access

You'll need to grant our operators admin rights to your infrastructure provider. Why? So we can manage your cluster's lifecycle - creating, configuring, and cleaning up resources like machines, networks, and security groups.
