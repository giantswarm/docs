Giant Swarm's mission is to empower customers to build their own Cloud Native Developer Platforms. We recognize that navigating through a landscape rife with hundreds of available projects for various tasks can be overwhelming. To streamline the process and avoid dispersion, many companies establish guidelines or catalogs that push for standardization, but if you have done that you know it is not enough.

Giving your engineering teams enough autonomy at the same time you standardize your toolchain can be challenging. In the end the developer journey looks similar for many of us, right:

We approach this challenge by offering a flexible baseline platform. The platform enables tech departments to ensure governance and control over development processes, while also allowing developers to navigate their development cycle smoothly. The succeeding documentation will introduce how we make it possible.

## Our platform your platform

You may wonder, how do we achieve flexibility and standardization concurrently? We don't offer a one-size-fits-all platform that covers 80% of your use cases, in the most optimistic scenario, but leave apart the rest. Instead, we trust in the Cloud Native ecosystem to provide set of capabilities that help platform teams to build the developer platform that aligns with companyâ€™s constraints, processes and rarities. We believe there isn't a universal [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/) that can cater to all needs, specially in the enterprise world.

Our approach will give you the ability to define team-specific policies, flexible applications delivery processes or various traffic routing setups. We will assist you in creating templates that cater to your team's needs, while maintaining excellent visibility and control over their activities.

## Working with our customers

We do not offer a turnkey product operational from day one. Instead, we work in daily basis with your engineers to build something together starting from a good baseline. There is a common ground where your security and governance team agreed upon. Since the platform built together will have some part operated by us and some other managed by you, there will be some communication and stretch support needed, which is exactly what we do.

At Giant Swarm, we take ownership of the platform's basic components and some managed apps that you can install on the platform. We operate these 24/7, providing you with upgrades and advice. Sometimes, there might be gray areas where your application doesn't function as expected due to shared platform components. Rest assured, we will troubleshoot such instances with you until they are resolved.
