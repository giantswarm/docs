Giant Swarm's mission is to empower customers to build their own Cloud Native Developer Platforms. Most of the engineering teams nowadays want o build a [platform](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#what-is-a-platform). There are [many reasons](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#why-platforms) why you would like to do it indeed, but let's recognize that sailing Cloud Native landscape rife today is overwhelming.

At the end of the day developers want to deploy an app to their systems without having to think too much about security or compliance but having good observability and delivery options. Our goal is to help the engineers that build and maintain the platform to achieve the developers expectations without sacrifice the security posture of their companies.

Giant Swarm approaches the challenge by offering a flexible baseline platform. The platform enables tech departments to ensure governance and control over development processes, while also allowing developers to navigate their development cycle smoothly. The succeeding documentation will introduce how we make it possible.

## Our platform your platform

You may wonder, how do we achieve flexibility and standardization concurrently? We don't offer a one-size-fits-all platform that covers 80% of your use cases, in the most optimistic scenario, leaving apart the rest of you company. Instead, we trust in the Cloud Native ecosystem to provide set of capabilities that help platform teams to build a developer platform that aligns with companyâ€™s constraints, processes and rarities. We believe there isn't a universal [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/) that can cater to all needs, specially in the enterprise world, and for that reason we make our solution composable and cuztomizable to your own desire.

Our approach will give you the ability to define team-specific policies, flexible applications delivery processes or various traffic routing setups. We will assist you in creating templates that cater to your team's needs, while maintaining excellent visibility and control over their activities.

## Working with our customers

We do not offer a turnkey product operational from day one. Our team work in daily basis with your engineers to build something together starting from a good baseline. There is a common ground where your security and governance team agreed upon. Since the platform is built in collaboration some part will be operated by us and some other managed by your teams. There will be some communication and stretch support needed, which is exactly what we do.

At Giant Swarm, we take ownership of the platform's basic components and some managed apps that you can install on the platform. We operate these 24/7, providing you with upgrades and advice. Sometimes, there might be gray areas where your application doesn't function as expected due to shared platform components. Rest assured, we will troubleshoot together until they are resolved.
