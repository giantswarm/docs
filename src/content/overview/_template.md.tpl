Describe from an overview point of view the area topic. Don`t go to deep into the matter, we have tutorials or reference pages for that purpose, here is just an introduction.

Here you can write an intro paragraph that responds to the question "What do we mean by `TOPIC_TO_DEVELOP`"

Recommended sections can help you to start with the article:

## Features

Explain what kind of uses cases we would like to cover. The main set of feature that we cover in this area. Don`t talk about specific tooling just the feature it enhances.

## Cloud-native applications

Which cloud native or built-in apps we have in our catalog to serve those use cases. Just match the features described with the tooling we offer and how it is integrated in our platform, always from a superficial point of view.
