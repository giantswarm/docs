title: The short title for this page is shown as the title in the upper section menu
description: At least 70 characters that describe the purpose of this page. Do not repeat the `title`, and do not use fill words such as "Overview of" or "A short explanation of how we".
weight: A number from 10 to 100 defining the order in the menu. Lower number = top of the menu, higher number = bottom of the menu. Use multiples of 10 (= 20, 30, 40, ...) when adding a page so that we can later easily put things in between, if necessary, without changing the weight in several files.

Could you describe the area topic from an overview point of view? Don`t go too deep into the matter; we have tutorials or reference pages for that purpose. Here is just an introduction.

Here, you can write an intro paragraph that responds to the question, "What do we mean by `TOPIC_TO_DEVELOP`"

Recommended sections can help you to start with the article:

## Capabilities

Explain what kind of use cases we would like to cover, as well as the main set of capabilities that we cover in this area. Don`t talk about specific tooling, just the feature it enhances.

## Cloud-native technologies

Which cloud-native or built-in apps do we have in our catalogue to serve those use cases? Could you just match the capabilities described with the tooling we offer and how it is integrated into our platform, always from a superficial point of view?
