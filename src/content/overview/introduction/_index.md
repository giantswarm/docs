Giant Swarm's mission is to empower our customers to build their own cloud-native [developer platform](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#what-is-a-platform). When development organizations and departments grow and their environments expand, they often face exponentially growing complexity in managing the lifecycle and operations of their application and services. Soon this gets overwhelming; to be fair, it's not our customers' core business. We believe that having a flexible, [unified cloud-native developer platform](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#why-platforms) plays a crucial role in growing your development organization efficiently. The platform not only helps to take [the toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) out of the development teams to have less cognitive load but also enables capabilities to manage security and governance more centrally.

Most of the developers want to deploy an app into production without having to worry too much about security or compliance, while maintaining control over deployment and monitoring options of their workloads. Our goal is to help the engineers who build and maintain the platform meet developers' expectations, without compromising their organizations' security posture.

Giant Swarm addresses this challenge by providing a flexible base platform. The platform enables technology departments to ensure governance and control over development processes and operations, while providing developers a smooth development cycle.

## Our platform, your platform

You might be asking: Can a platform be both adaptable and standardized? Absolutely. Giant Swarm doesn't offer a generic solution that tries to cover most needs but ignores the rest. Instead, we use cloud-native technology to give platform teams the tools to build a developer platform that perfectly matches their company's specific requirements and processes. We understand that every organization, especially large ones, has unique needs. That's why we've designed our solutions to be flexible and customizable, so you get exactly what you need.

Our approach gives you the ability to define team-specific policies, flexible application delivery processes, or different traffic routing setups, just to name a few of the options. We help you create templates tailored to your team's needs while ensuring excellent visibility and control over their activities.

## Working with our customers

We offer a product that lets you start easily with a total open-source production-ready platform, no vendor locking, and no commercial license. Our team will work with your engineers every day to build something that's tailor-made to meet the challenges of your business head-on. There is a common baseline that your security and governance team can trust on. Your specific requirements will be discussed and configured in collaboration with our subject matter experts. Good communication and support are key, which is exactly what we're good at. [Our customers endorse the collaborative effort to create a cloud-native developer platform](https://www.giantswarm.io/customers) together.

At Giant Swarm, we take full responsibility for keeping the platform components healthy. We operate and monitor them on a continual basis and offer you upgrades and support. Even in cases where **your** application doesn't work as expected, we'll assist you to the best of our considerable abilities, until they do.
