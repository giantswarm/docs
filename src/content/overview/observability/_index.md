Check first the template (https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/pull/2180/files) it is still on development and you feedback is welcome, but you can take it as a reference.

Concepts come to my mind when I think on observability (worthy to mention here without going deep):

- Monitoring
- Logging
- Tracing
- Alerting
- Profiling

The main idea is to write a brief description of observability in general from an introductory point of view setting the high-level goals we would like to achieve.

## Features

Describe what use cases are covered by the observability features.

## Cloud-native technologies
