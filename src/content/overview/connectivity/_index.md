Check first the template (https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/pull/2180/files) it is still on development and you feedback is welcome, but you can take it as a reference.

Concepts come to my mind when I think on connectivity (worthy to mention here without going deep):

- public/private networking
- CNI
- Policies
- Ingress
- API gateway
- Service mesh
- DNS
- egress proxy

The main idea is to write a brief description of connectivity and networking in general from an introductory point of view setting the high-level goals we would like to achieve.

## Features

Describe what use cases are covered by the connectivity features.

## Cloud-native technologies

- What technologies are used to provide connectivity in Giant Swarm?
