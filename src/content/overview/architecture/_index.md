<!-- I like the current structure of the platform arch page to be honest but the content is too specific in some places, and maybe too much I will make it shorter. -->

Proposed outline:

- Intro paragraph
- Main diagram with description of the layers <!-- I added a review to the main diagram in miro https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO2Dh15w=/ -->
- One or two paragraph section for each layer/section of the diagram

Ensure during the description of each layer/section we link to the relevant documentation page that goes into more detail.
