Check first the template (https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/pull/2180/files) it is still on development and you feedback is welcome, but you can take it as a reference.

Concepts come to my mind when I think on continuous delivery (worthy to mention here without going deep):

- GitOps (declarative approach)
- Pul versus push
- You can define apps but also configuration or infrastructure too
- Automation always helps (templating we offer)
