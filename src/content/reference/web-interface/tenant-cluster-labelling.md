# Giant Swarm Tenant Cluster Labelling in The Web Interface

Labels are a mechanism to assign short pieces of additional information to your Giant Swarm tenant clusters.
For more information about this feature, check out the [Labelling tenant clusters](/guides/tenant-cluster-labelling/) user guide.

## Viewing tenant cluster labels

The cluster details page shows the labels currently attached to the current cluster in the "General" tab below the tenant cluster release information.

## Editing tenant cluster labels

Each label is editable by clicking on its key or label part.
Doing so opens a tooltip where you can make changes and confirm them.

Your changes will be validated to match the [Kubernetes labels syntax and character set](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).
It is not possible to save invalid changes.
