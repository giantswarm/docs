The security in the Giant Swarm platform is based on a policy engine, `Kyverno`, which enforces the [`Pod Security Standards (PSS)`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) and even extend them with custom policies. All the workload clusters run an instance of `Kyverno` that enforces the policies defined by the platform team.

In this guide, you will learn how to make your application compliant with the `Pod Security Standards` and how create policy exceptions when needed.
