Today, `getting started` pages are about guiding a new user, or platform engineer, to build their platform with Giant Swarm. The articles are ordered to be followed one after the other to show all features we offer from the suffice. Dont go to deep into the topics, we have tutorials or reference pages for that purpose, here is just an introduction.

Recommended sections can help you to start with the article:

## Introduction

General definition of the area/topic you are going to develop. Since this is a step across the getting started section it has a previous and after page entry, so be aware it has continuity.

## Prerequisites

Indicate if the user needs to have installed any specific tool or should have read or prepared their local environment before.

## Steps

List of sequence steps that users will follow to accomplish the goal described in the introduction.

## Conclusion

Wrap-up of what has been done. Comment what it is next, so the user can continue the journey
