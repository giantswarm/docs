Today, the `getting started` pages are about guiding a new user or platform engineer to build their platform with Giant Swarm. The articles are ordered to be followed one after the other to show all the features we offer from the suffice. If you want to go deeper into the topics, we have tutorials or reference pages for that purpose. Here is just an introduction.

Recommended sections can help you to start with the article:

## Introduction (does not need the header)

General description of the goal you want to achieve. Since this is a step across the getting started section it has a previous and after page entry, so be aware it has continuity.

## Requirements

Indicate if the user needs to have installed any specific tool or should have read or prepared their local environment before.

## Steps

List of sequence steps that users will follow to accomplish the goal described in the introduction.

## Next steps

Wrap-up of what has been done and what is the next natural step in user journey.
