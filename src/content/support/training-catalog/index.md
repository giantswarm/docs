Giant Swarm perceives the cloud-native landscape as a journey, and it takes time and effort to get across it successfully. Based on the lessons learnt through these years helping our customers, our teams have built a training set that guides customers to understand the principles and the tools. The training is why-focused rather than how-focused, meaning that the aim is to explain the reasons behind the tools and practices, rather than just how to use them.
