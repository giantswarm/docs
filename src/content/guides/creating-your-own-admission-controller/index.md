# Creating your own admission controller

The Kubernetes API is an amazing territory. Thanks to being built around the REST model, give us the possibility to manage all our workloads using HTTP requests. Tools like `kubectl` or `Kubernetes dashboard` take advantage of this helping to manage the different resources. But Kubernetes API is far more. Let's take a deeper look at how it is composed:

<image_api_server_architecture>

The picture highlights the different components living inside the API component. The request starts the API journey facing with the authentication controller. Once the request is authenticated, the authorization module dictates if the request issuer can perform or not the operation. After the request is properly authorized, the admission magic comes to place. 

There are two types of admission controllers in Kubernetes. They work slightly different. First one, it is the validation controller, which proxy the requests to the subscribed webhooks. The Kubernetes API register the webhooks based on the resource type and the request method. Every webhook runs some logic to validate the incoming resource and it replies to the API with a verdict. In case the validation webhook rejects the request, Kubernetes API returns a failed HTTP response to the user. Otherwise, it continues to the next admission.

The second admission controller is called `mutate` as it modifies the resource submitted by the user. The cluster admins can registry mutation controllers as webhooks to be run in a chain same as validation controllers.

Also, Kubernetes API allows you to register your own cluster resource objects, called `Custom Resource Definition`. Even you can create an API extension server which listen to a new REST path. But in this guide, we focus on the admission controller capabilities.

## Goal

Our goal here is to create a simple validation controller which will empower us to influence the pod creation. Although there many more possibilities and the logic could be as complex as you want, the goal is just to create a basic version which makes a simple validation. The reader can always find more real examples in the links on the bottom.

Our example controller will be called `grumpy` and will reject all new pods with a name different than `smooth-app`. I recognize it is tempting sometimes deploy this controller in a real cluster ;).

## How API proxy the requests

The Kubernetes API server needs to know when and where sending the incoming request to our admission controller. The Kubernetes nature advocates to use declarative state always and here it is not an exception. Below we define a `ValidationWebhookConfiguration` which gives the needed information to the API:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: grumpy
webhooks:
  - name: grumpy.giantswarm.io
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: grumpy
        namespace: default
        path: "/validate"
      caBundle: "${CA_BUNDLE}"
    rules:
      - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        resources: ["pods"]
```

The configuration definition is pretty obvious. It can be observed there are two main parts to be considered. In the first one, `clientConfig`, we define where our service can be found (can be an external URL too), and the `path` which our validation server will listen. Also, you notice there is a `CA` to be defined. Since security is always important, adding the cert authority will tell Kubernetes API to use HTTPS and validate our server using the passed asset. In the next section, it will be explained how to generate all the certs needed.

The second part specifies which rules will follow the API to decide if a request should be forward for validation to `grumpy` or not. Here it is configured that only requests with method equal to `CREATE` and resource type `pod` will be forwarded. 

## Generate the certificates and the CA

Since the scope of this guide is not teaching how you can build a PKI bundle, we have created a script, `gen_cert.sh`, in the grumpy repository which generates a CA bundle and a keypair for our grumpy server. Also we need to provide the CA in the webhook displayed before, in order to allow the Kubernetes API to create a secure connection against our shiny controller.

__Node:__ Inside the aforementioned script there are comments explaining the commands executed in case you have interest what has be done under the hood.

Hence at this moment our validation webhook configuration must contain a encoded certify authority. The script besides create the certificates and the CA, inject the later in the manifest used to deploy our server.

```
$ cat manifest.yaml | grep caBundle
```

At the same time we need to create a secret to place the certificates. After we apply the manifest, the pod will mount the secret files into a directory.

```
$ kubectl create secret generic grumpy \
        --from-file=key.pem=certs/grumpy-key.pem \
        --from-file=cert.pem=certs/grumpy-crt.pem
```

## Deploy grumpy server

## Test the validation controller

## Explain main code blocks

In this example we have chosen go-lang to create the admission controller just because is the Kubernetes de facto language, but you could use whicever language you prefer and it should work the same.

Let's start defining a server with the certs created inside the grumpy secret.

__Note:__ The code examples has been striped them out to make easier the understanding. For further look browse to the [repository](github.com/gianstwarm/grumpy).

```go

  // Read the certs from the convined path and convert it to a X509 keypair
  flag.StringVar(&tlscert, "tlsCertFile", "/etc/certs/cert.pem", "x509 Certificate for HTTPS.")
	flag.StringVar(&tlskey, "tlsKeyFile", "/etc/certs/key.pem", "x509 private key to --tlsCertFile.")
  certs, _ := tls.LoadX509KeyPair(tlscert, tlskey)

  // Create a secure http server
	server := &http.Server{
		Addr:      ":80",
		TLSConfig: &tls.Config{Certificates: []tls.Certificate{certs}},
	}

	// Create a handler listening to the 'validate' path and start the server
	gs := GrumpyServerHandler{}
	mux.HandleFunc("/validate", gs.serve)
	server.ListenAndServeTLS("", "")

```

Inside the grumpy package we define a `server` handler which reads the request body, then it converts the data to the correct struct and finally check if the resource name is valid.

```go
  if data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body); err == nil {
		body = data
	}
  
  arRequest := v1beta1.AdmissionReview{}
	json.Unmarshal(body, &arRequest)

	if arRequest.Request.Name != "smooth-app" {
		return
	}
```

In case the request name is not the expected one (`smooth-app`), our handler creates a response notifying the rejection.

```go
  ar := v1beta1.AdmissionReview{
		Response: &v1beta1.AdmissionResponse{
			Allowed: false,
			Result: &metav1.Status{
				Message: "Keep calm and not add more crap in the cluster!",
			},
		},
	}
	resp, err := json.Marshal(ar)
```
