# Prepare an Azure subscription to run Giant Swarm tenant clusters

In a Giant Swarm installation the tenant clusters (the clusters running your Kubernetes workloads) can run in a separate Azure subscription from the control plane. This gives greater flexibility depending on the requirements and the use case. For example, it allows the control plane to be running in one Azure subscription, while tenant clusters operate in different Azure subscriptions, depending on the customer entities using them.

Giant Swarm operates tenant clusters using a service called `azure-operator` which runs on the control plane.

## Overview

In order to run Giant Swarm tenant clusters, an Azure subscription needs the following elements:

- Role definition: a set of permission to operate tenant clusters in the Azure subscription.
- Service Principal: an identity (bound to the previously defined Role definition) to access the Azure subscription.

## Create Azure role definition and Service Principal

In order to perform necessary actions to deploy and maintain tenant clusters in your Azure subscription, `azure-operator` needs to access the subscription using a Service Principal.
Below we detail the steps necessary to set it up.

### 1. Prerequisites

To create a Service Principal you need:

- An account with [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) or [User Access Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role.
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed.

### 2. Role definition

Download our Role definition template:

```json
{
  "Name": "azure-operator",
  "Description": "Role for github.com/giantswarm/azure-operator",
  "Actions": [
    "*"
  ],
  "NotActions": [
    "Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action"
  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
  ]
}
```

Open it and replace `${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}` with your subscription id.

To find out your subscription ID you can use [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade), as shown in the screenshot below:

![Azure Subscriptions list](/img/azure-subscriptions-list.png)

Alternatively you can use the Azure CLI as follows:

```nohighlight
$ az account list --output table
Name     CloudName    SubscriptionId                        State    IsDefault
-------  -----------  ------------------------------------  -------  -----------
Example  AzureCloud   6ec148b8-8bea-4dd3-82bc-1787c8260e4a  Enabled  True
```

With the edited role definition in the file `guest.json`, create the role definition using the Azure CLI:

```nohighlight
az role definition create --role-definition @guest.json
```

On success this command prints the created role definition.

### 3. Service principal

Create the service principal using the Azure CLI:

```nohighlight
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "azure-operator-sp" --role "azure-operator" --query '{client_id:appId, secret_key:password, tenant_id:tenant, subscription_id:""}'
{
    "client_id": "72bc3de4-3cf8-46c5-bd2b-243368ed0622",
    "secret_key": "d6b2cb93-cae9-44b3-8ec5-dc5feb8c28ba",
    "subscription_id": null,
    "tenant_id": "31f75bf9-3d8c-4691-95c0-83dd71613db8"
}
```

## Configure the Giant Swarm organization

In the previous section, we explained how to create the Service Principal in the Azure subscription in order to run Giant Swarm tenant clusters.

Giant Swarm tenant clusters are owned by organizations. This allows you to control access to clusters, since only members of the owner organization have access to the management functions of a cluster.

In order to run a tenant cluster in your Azure subscription, the organization owning your cluster has to know about the Service Principal you just created.

If you have direct access to the Giant Swarm API, please set the credentials of
your organization with our [gsctl](/reference/gsctl/) CLI. Look for the
[`update organization set-credentials`](/reference/gsctl/update-org-set-credentials/#azure)
command. You will need your Azure subscription ID and the output from step 3 as arguments.

In case you are working with a Giant Swarm partner, you might not have access to the Giant Swarm API. In that case, please provide your Azure subscription ID and the output from step 3 to your partner contact.

After the organization's credentials are set, you can create clusters owned by that
organization. These clusters' resources will be created in your Azure subscription.

## Configure Subscription to allow access for Giant Swarm Support

Last step while configuring your Subscription is to grant access for Giant Swarm Ops/Support to your subscription in order to provide 24/7 support. Access to the portal is important part of the provided support, where in some cases manual interventions have to take place.
Easiest way is to use the Azure Lighthouse service, that allows to delegate the management of resources to third parties. While following this part of the guide, you will allow the Giant Swarm Staff group to manage your resources. This is beneficial as you will not have to manage access for each person separately within your subscription, but you will be adding a managed group that is kept up to date with the current active Giant Swarm Staff from our side.

We require a built in role `Contributor` to access the resources that Giant Swarm is deploying and it can be used by default from the [Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

You can also create your own role assignment with restrictions to access specific Resource Groups, however it needs to be remembered to refresh the role with every newly created cluster so we can provide full support starting from the clusters creation.

When all is set you can simply run this command:

```nohighlight
az deployment create --name <deploymentName (unique by subscription)> \
                     --location <AzureRegion> \
                     --template-file delegatedResourceManagement.json \
                     --parameters delegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json \
                     --verbose
```

You will have to supply a general Delegated Resource Management [template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/azure-operator/master/docs/delegatedResourceManagement.json).

The Delegated Resource Management template uses a [parameters file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/azure-operator/master/docs/delegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json) to supply the needed variables for configuration.
Please remember to change the `roleDefinitionId` in case you would like to use your custom role definition. Moreover ask your Solution Engineer so he can provide you the `GiantSwarmPrincipalID` and `GiantSwarmTenantID`

This command should be run for all subscriptions that are used for Giant Swarm tenant clusters as well as the control plane that orchestrates it all.
