# Creating workload clusters via the Management API

Here we explain how to create clusters using the [Control Plane Kuebernetes API](/basics/api/#management-api). This API lets you work directly with custom resources (CRs), which are specific for the cloud provider you are running on.

**Note:** At this point, bare metal (KVM) is not supported yet.
