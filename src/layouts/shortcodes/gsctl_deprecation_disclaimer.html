<div class="well disclaimer"><p>gsctl and the <a href="/ui-api/rest-api/">REST API</a> are being phased out. We don't have an end-of-life date yet. However, we recommend to familiarize yourself with our <a href="/ui-api/management-api/">Management API</a> and the <a href="/ui-api/kubectl-gs/">kubectl gs</a> plugin as a future-proof replacement. We provide a <a href="/ui-api/gsctl/migrate/">migration page</a> to help you with the transition.</p></div>
