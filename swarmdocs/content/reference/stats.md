# Getting instance statistics

The `swarm stats` command allows you to get information on the current system load for a specific instance.

## Command syntax

The command requires an instance ID as the first argument.

```nohighlight
$ swarm stats <instance_id>
```

<!-- TODO: Create reference page on instance IDs and link from here. -->

## Output

Here is an example output:

```nohighlight
component               memory usage (mb)  memory capacity (mb)  memory usage (%)  cpu usage (%)
docs/docsservice/nginx  16.19              3956.24               0.41              2
