# Listing applications

The `swarm ls` helps you to find out which applications are configured in your current environment and what their status is.

## Command syntax

The command is simply called without any arguments, like this:

```nohighlight
$ swarm ls
```

## Output

You get a table-like output of your applications. Here is an example:

```nohighlight
2 applications available:

application      environment  created              status
graphhopper-cgn  marian/dev   2014-12-09 11:07:45  up
twofishes        marian/dev   2014-12-18 06:43:11  down
```

The columns in detail:

 * `application`: The application name as defined in your application configuration
 * `environment`: The environment name the application is running in
 * `created`: The UTC date and time when the application has been created
 * `status`: The overall status of the application

## Application status meaning

The application status is an aggregate of the statuses of all component instances within that application. When reported on an application level, the possible statuses and their meaning are:

 * `up`: All component instances are running.
 * `starting`: One or more component instances, possibly all of them, are currently being started, some might already be up.
 * `down`: At least one component instances is currently down (meaning neither running nor started. This might as well mean. Any number of other instances might be up or starting.
 * `failed`: At least one component instance has a failure. Any number of other instances might be down, starting or up.
