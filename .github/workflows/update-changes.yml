            This PR has been created automatically by the 'Update Changes and Releases' Github workflow.

            If you see relevant additions in the 'Files' tab, feel free to **Approve** this PR.
            (Non-relevant additions would be, for example, a docs release that only updates the Changelog
            section.)
            
            Otherwise, leave the PR open. It will be updated periodically as new entries arrive in the
            Changes and Releases section.
