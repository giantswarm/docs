            This PR has been created automatically by the 'Update Changes and Releases' Github workflow.

            If you see relevant additions in the 'Files' tab, feel free to merge it into master any time
            without review and then create a docs release.

            Non-relevant additions would be, for example, a docs release that only updates the Changelog
            section.
