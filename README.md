# Giant Swarm User Documentation

This is the main documentation repository for the documentation available at https://docs.giantswarm.io.

## Repository overview

This repository named `docs` holds the main **content** of our documentation. The documentation
site is created using the static site generator [HUGO](http://gohugo.io/) based on Markdown files
in the `src/content/` directory. Images are in the `src/static/img/` directory.

Additional content is tied in through the scripts

- `scripts/aggregate-changelogs`: Aggregates changelog entries into the `src/content/changes` destination.
- `scripts/update-crd-reference`: Generates reference pages for our custom resource definitions in the `src/content/reference/cp-k8s-api` destination.
- `scripts/update-external-repos`: Tutorials that need their own code repository. They must have a `docs` subfolder with the Markdown content and optionally some images. Configuration is found in `scripts/update-external-repos/repositories.txt`.

To update these external content types, the `Makefile` provides specific targets:

- `make changes`
- `make update-external-repos`
- `make update-crd-reference`

## Related repositories and components

There are several additional repositories which provide additional functionality:

- [docs-proxy](https://github.com/giantswarm/docs-proxy/): nginx proxy server which integrates the search engine and the API spec (see below) into the documentation site, and provides some additional configuration, e. g. regarding HTTP headers.

- [api-spec](https://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec/): Specification (in Swagger/OpenAPI) format for the Giant Swarm API. Available in the docs site under https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/.

- [sitesearch](https://github.com/giantswarm/sitesearch/): Search engine for the documentation site.

- [indexer](https://github.com/giantswarm/docs-indexer/): Indexing tool that pushes new content to the `sitesearch` index periodically, to keep the search engine up-to-date.

## Deploying

To publish the content in this repository, a release is needed. Releases are created automatically for every push to the `master` branch, so normally whenever a pull request gets merged.

To publish the release, update the version of App `docs-app` in `gollum` in namespace `c68pn`. You can use this command:

```nohighlight
kubectl --context giantswarm-gollum -n c68pn patch app docs-app --type merge -p '{"spec": {"version": "X.Y.Z"}}'
```

Here, `giantswarm-gollum` is the kubeconfig context created by `opsctl create kubeconfig -i gollum`. `X.Y.Z` is to be replaced by the new version number of the app, without `v` prefix.

Latest content should be visible after a short period. When checking, make sure to circumvent any browser cache. For example, do this by keeping the Shift key pressed while hitting the reload button of your browser.

TODO: update this section as soon as app-updater is working.
