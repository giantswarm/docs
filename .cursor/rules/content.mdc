# Content editing rules

Apply these rules whenever creating, editing or deleting content in the `src/content` directory.

## URL to path mapping

- The folder `src` represents a HUGO site published at https://docs.giantswarm.io/
- Each page URL maps to a markdown file in the folder. For example:
  - `https://docs.giantswarm.io/overview/security/platform-security/` maps to `src/content/overview/security/_index.md`
  - `https://docs.giantswarm.io/overview/observability/alert-management/alert-routing/` maps to `src/content/overview/observability/alert-management/alert-routing/index.md`

## Markdown rules

- Leave a blank line between a headline and the following paragraph
- The page headline is rendered by the HTML template based on the `title` frontmatter field and must not be part of the markdown body
- Lint markdown after editing

## Linking

- Links to other pages within docs.giantswarm.io are set using the `relref` shortcode.
- The relref parameter always starts with a forward slash.
